## Advantages of SPAC merger v. IPO

* **Faster execution than an IPO:** A SPAC merger usually occurs in 3–6 months on average, while an IPO usually takes 12–18 months.
* **Upfront price discovery: **Your IPO price depends on market conditions at the time of listing, whereas you negotiate the pricing with the SPAC before the transaction closes—which is much more advantageous in a volatile market.&#x20;
* **Possibility of raising additional capital:** SPAC sponsors will raise debt or PIPE (private investment in public equity) funding in addition to their original capital to not only fund the transaction but also to fuel growth for the combined company. This backstop debt and equity are intended to ensure a completed transaction even if some SPAC investors redeem their shares.&#x20;
* **Lower costs of marketing: **A SPAC merger doesn’t need to generate interest from investors in public exchanges with an extensive roadshow (although raising PIPE involves targeted roadshows).&#x20;
* **Access to operational expertise:** SPAC sponsors often are experienced financial and industrial professionals. They can tap into their network of contacts to offer management expertise or take on a role themselves on the board.

## Disadvantages of SPAC merger v. IPO&#x20;

* **Shareholding dilution:** SPAC sponsors usually own a 20 percent stake in the SPAC through founder shares or “promote,” as well as warrants to purchase more shares. SPAC sponsors also benefit from an earnout component, allowing them to receive more shares when the stock price achieves a specified target over a certain time frame which could lead to further dilution.&#x20;
* **Capital shortfall from potential redemption:** Initial SPAC investors may redeem their shares. If redemptions exceed expectations, then cash availability becomes uncertain and forces SPACs to raise PIPE financing to fill the resulting shortfall.&#x20;
* **Compressed timeline for public company readiness:** Although the SPAC sponsor may offer help during the merger process, the target company usually takes the brunt of preparing for required financials in the SEC filings and establishing public company functions, such as investor relations and internal controls, under a much shorter deadline than in an IPO.
* **Financial diligence performed at narrower scope:** The SPAC process does not require the rigorous due diligence of a traditional IPO, which could lead to potential restatements, incorrectly valued businesses, or even lawsuits.&#x20;
* **Lack of underwriting and comfort letter:** In a traditional IPO, the underwriter makes sure all regulatory requirements are met but because a SPAC is already public, the target company doesn’t have an underwriter.
