## Money With State

### Fractional-Reserve Banking

There are two types of money created in a fractional-reserve banking system operating with a central bank:

1. **Central bank money:** money created or adopted by the central bank regardless of its form â€“ precious metals, commodity certificates, banknotes, coins, electronic money loaned to commercial banks, or anything else the central bank chooses as its form of money.
2. **Commercial bank money:** demand deposits in the commercial banking system; also referred to as "checkbook money", "sight deposits" or simply "credit".

When a deposit of central bank money is made at a commercial bank, the central bank money is removed from circulation and added to the commercial banks' reserves (it is no longer counted as part of [M1 money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\_supply#Empirical\_measures)). Simultaneously, an equal amount of new commercial bank money is created in the form of bank deposits.

### Monetary Base

The monetary base includes:

* The total [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency) circulating in the public,
* Plus the currency that is physically held in the [vaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\_vault) of [commercial banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\_bank),
* Plus the [commercial banks'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\_bank) [reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\_reserves) held in the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\_bank).

### Reserve Requirements

The currently prevailing view of [reserve requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve\_requirement) is that they are intended to prevent banks from:

1. generating too much money by making too many loans against a narrow money deposit base;
2. having a shortage of cash when large deposits are withdrawn (although a legal minimum reserve amount is often established as a regulatory requirement, reserves may be made available on a temporary basis in the event of a crisis or [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\_run)).



### Liquidity and Capital Management

A bank must respond when the actual ratio falls below the reserve ratio target. This can be accomplished in several ways, including:&#x20;

1. Selling or redeeming other assets, or [securitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization) of illiquid assets,
2. Restricting investment in new loans,
3. Borrowing funds (whether repayable on demand or at a fixed maturity),
4. Issuing additional [capital instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital\_requirement#Regulatory\_capital), or
5. Reducing [dividends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend).

As an additional safeguard, banks often maintain a stock of low cost and reliable sources of liquidity, including:

1. Demand deposits with other banks
2. High-quality marketable debt securities
3. Committed lines of credit with other banks
