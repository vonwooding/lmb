### Energy Consumption v. Energy Conversion

The total [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) of an [isolated system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated\_system) remains constant and thus is [conserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation\_law) over time. Bitcoin is an isolated system. Mining for the block reward and transaction fee does not waste energy. Miners convert electricity into a new type of monetary energy, which is conserved over time in accordance with Bitcoin's issuance schedule. &#x20;

> "The \[thermodynamic] law is called the _conservation of energy_. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. " - [Conservation of Energy at Caltec](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I\_04.html)

"[#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash\&ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) does not consume electricity to process transactions. Bitcoin transactions on Layer 2 platforms like [#Lightning](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lightning?src=hash\&ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw)⚡️ or Layer 3 applications like [@CashApp](https://twitter.com/CashApp?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) are instantaneous & effectively free. The electricity is used to secure the network and ensure its integrity over time."

### Department of Energy Projects 40% of US Electricity will be Solar by 2035

The Biden administration on Wednesday released a report showing the United States can get 40% of its electricity from solar energy by 2035, a significant jump. - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-administration-set-goal-45-solar-energy-by-2050-nyt-2021-09-08/)&#x20;



[#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash\&ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) mining converts wasted & stranded energy into digital energy, the natural successor to chemical & electrical energy. It can be managed by any computer, transferred anywhere at the speed of light, and lasts forever, thereby improving our climate, economy & power grid.
