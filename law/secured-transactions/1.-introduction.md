### Enforcement&#x20;

Enforcing the rights and responsibilities of the secured party and the debtor under the agreement and in accordance with UCC guidelines.&#x20;

### Perfection

How public notice of the security interest is given.

### Priority

The rights of the secured party relative to other claimants to the collateral, such as other creditors of the debtor, persons who may have purchased the collateral from the debtor, or a trustee in bankruptcy.

## Types of Secured Transactions

#### **Consensual security interests in personal property and fixtures.**

The principal type of transaction to which Article 9 applies is the consensual security interest in personal property. When two parties enter into a contract whereby one party gives value, either by lending money or selling an item on credit, and the other party puts up personal property as collateral to secure repayment of the loan or credit sale, then Article 9 governs.&#x20;

#### **Agricultural liens, non-consensual interests in farm products.**

Article 9 now covers agricultural liens. These are nonconsensual liens on farm products that arise by operation of a state statute.

#### **Credit sales disguised as leases.**

If the transaction is called a lease but is in fact disguised sale on a credit with retention of a security interest, then Article 9 does apply, and the "lessor" (actually, the credit seller) must file a financing statement to protect its reversion interest in the property.

#### **Certain types of consignments.**

Article 9 is intended to protect creditors against "secret liens." Accordingly, unless the merchant is _"generally known by its creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others"_  that is, is generally known to be in the consignment business then Article 9 applies and a person who consigns more than $1000 worth of goods to a merchant must file a financing statement giving notice of the consignment arrangement.

#### The sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, and promissory notes.

Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code extends to the sale of accounts. A person who purchases the accounts of a business must file a financing statement giving public notice of the transaction. This rule also extends to the sale of chattel paper, another type of property that may be proceeds from the sale of inventory.

## Article 9 Exemptions

1. The use of real property as collateral to secure repayment
2. True leases
3. Consignments where the consignee is generally known by its creditors to be in the business of selling the goods of others
4. Nonconsensual liens other than agricultural liens, such as landlord liens and artisan's liens
5. Subrogation rights
6. Collateral covered by federal filing systems such as those for airplanes and ships
7. A sale of accounts which occurs in connection with the sale of an entire business
8. An isolated sale of an account which does not constitute a substantial portion of the debtor's accounts
9. A security interest in a consumer's bank account arising out of a consumer transaction
10. The assignment of a right represented by a judgment

## Financing Statements

A financing statement is a form (UCC1) that is filed with a public office to give notice to others of a security interest. Most financing statements must be filed centrally with the office of the Secretary of State, but some financing statements are filed locally with the real property records. In most cases financing statements must be filed in the state where the debtor is located, but in some cases financing statements are filed in the state where the collateral is located. Financing statements must contain the names of the debtor and the secured party as well as a description of the collateral. The name of the debtor must not be "seriously misleading,' but the description of the collateral may be "supergeneric." Financing statements are effective for a period of five years but may be renewed by filing a continuation statement during the six-month period prior to lapse. Other types of UCC forms include addendums, information statements, amendments (including continuation statements and termination statements), and information requests. Parties may file financing statements designating themselves as lessors or consignors instead of as secured parties.

## Common Mistakes in Financing Statements

1\. Using an incorrect name for the debtor. If the name of the debtor on the financing statement is “seriously misleading” then the financing statement is ineffective.

2\. Failing to accurately describe the collateral. If the financing statement does not sufficiently “indicate” the collateral then it is ineffective. Overgeneralized descriptions (“all personal property of the debtor”) are permitted but inaccurate descriptions (“inventory” instead of “equipment”) are ineffective.

3\. If the collateral is timber to be cut, as-extracted collateral, or fixtures, submit both the UCC1 and the Addendum form (UCC1ad). Accurately complete the required information in Items 13, 14, 15, and 16. This will be filed in the office of the County Recorder where the collateral is located.

4\. Using the wrong form. The various forms are:

a. The standard financing statement (UCC1)

b. The addendum (UCC1ad)

c. The additional party (UCC1AP)

d. The amendment (UCC3)

e. The amendment addendum (UCC3ad)

f. The amendment additional party (UCC3AP)

g. The information request (UCC11)

h. The Information Statement (UCC5)

See [https://www.dos.pa.gov/BusinessCharities/Business/RegistrationForms/Pages/default.aspx#.VIXs32exWBo](https://www.dos.pa.gov/BusinessCharities/Business/RegistrationForms/Pages/default.aspx#.VIXs32exWBo).

5\. Failing to file a continuation statement during the 6-month window at the end of the five-year term (UCC3).

6\. Failing to file a termination statement when all amounts have been paid and the secured party has no more obligation to extend credit (UCC3).

7\. Not filing an amendment within four months after the debtor’s name has changed (UCC3).

8\. Not filing a new UCC1 within four months if the debtor’s assets have been acquired by a “new debtor” with a different name.

9\. Failing to keep track of whether the debtor has moved out-of-state. Within four months you must refile a financing statement in the state where the debtor is now located.

10\. Failing to keep track of whether the debtor has sold the collateral to someone in another state. Within one year you must refile under the name of the purchaser in the state where the purchaser is located.

11\. (Just for good measure.) Failing to pay the filing fee!



## Proceeds

When a debtor sells or otherwise disposes of collateral, whatever is received by the debtor in return is proceeds, and the creditor's security interest automatically attaches to the proceeds and is automatically perfected.&#x20;

However, for many types of collateral the perfection lapses after 20 days; in addition, it is often difficult to trace proceeds particularly when they are cash proceeds that are deposited into a bank account.
