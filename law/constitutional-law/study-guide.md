## Administrative State

### The Nondelegation Doctrine

The U.S. Constitution separates the federal government into three branches, each equipped with a specific set of inalienable powers and authority under Articles I, II and III.  The nondelegation doctrine refers to the notion that Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to administrative agencies, department heads, private organizations or other entities.

The Supreme Court has held that "Congress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested." [A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/495/). Justice Scalia noted that leniency with respect to the nondelegation doctrine can give rise to a "junior-varsity Congress" consisting of non-elected government agents who legislate without accountability from voters. ([UPenn Law Review](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=\&httpsredir=1\&article=9565\&context=penn\_law\_review)). &#x20;

But, as highlighted by [Stanford Law Review](https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/69-Stan-L-Rev-359.pdf), "Administrative law rests on two fictions. The first, the nondelegation doctrine, imagines that Congress does not delegate legislative power to agencies." In reality, Congress enacts statues permitting agencies to issue regulations and rules. "Typically, when Congress passes a law to create an agency, it grants that agency general authority to regulate certain activities within our society." ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the\_rulemaking\_process.pdf)). From 1995-2016, 88,899 agency rules were promulgated compared to 4,312 public laws enacted by Congress.

Whereas true legislation is drafted by elected lawmakers, rules and regulations are promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act's "notice‐and‐comment process", which requires that the proposed rule be published in the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov) for public comment.&#x20;
