## US v. Richardson

### Issue

Whether the respondent has standing to bring action as a federal taxpayer alleging that provisions concerning public reporting of expenditures under the CIA Act of 1949 violate Article 1.9.7 of the Constitution.&#x20;

> "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account for the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time." -**Constitution**

Basically, may a taxpayer challenge the constitutionality of an administrative agency law? The dissent says that Richardson sought to enforce his right to access a published document detailing the CIA's Receipts and Expenditures.

### Burger

No. Case is similar to Frothingham v Mellon. Taxpayer could not enjoin the Fed. Maternity Act or prove sufficient damage. "Minute and uncertain future injury" is insufficient. Plaintiff must be in "immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury" and "allege personal injury uncommon to the general public" to have standing.

Richardson did not allege a significant, direct injury to himself from the CIA’s failure to report expenditures. Plaintiff must show connection between their status as a taxpayer and a specific claimed right that has been violated.&#x20;

> "Any plaintiff seeking to challenge an act of Congress on the grounds that it violates his or her rights as a taxpayer meet a two-prong standing test: the plaintiff must bring allegations&#x20;
>
> **(1) challenging an enactment under the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution, and **
>
> **(2) claiming that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed on the taxing and spending power.**"

**Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937) **

> "A private citizen has standing to challenge government action when he shows that he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of government action."

### Powell

Concurrence, no standing. Taxpayers or citizens rarely have standing because the government knows how to take advantage of the rules and laws it creates.&#x20;

### Douglas

Dissent. Richardson has a constitutional and personal right as a taxpayer to obtain accurate and current information about CIA expenditures. Denial of that right creates sufficient standing.&#x20;

### Stewart & Marshall

Dissent. Richardson brought a claim under the Statement and Account Clause of the Constitution alleging that, as a taxpayer, he had a right to a detailed description of how the CIA was spending federal money, and that the government owed him an affirmative duty to supply this information.

Richardson's claim in fact revolves around the second phrase

> "a regular Statement and Account fo the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."

### Brennan

Dissent. Federal taxpayers have standing if they suffer a “distinctive and discriminating” economic injury due to the government action. The injury alleged by Richardson and other federal taxpayers in these types of cases was** concrete and economic** in that it pertained to how the government was spending taxpayer funds.
