## Judicial Review of Federal Law

The authority for judicial review was first announced by the Supreme Court in **Marbury v. Madison** in 1803.

The power to declare federal laws unconstitutional is an **implied power**, derived from Article III and Article VI of the Constitution.&#x20;

As a result, courts now possess the authority for judicial review of both **federal executive and legislative acts**.

1. How does the Court justify judicial review of executive actions?
2. When is such judicial review available and when is it unavailable?&#x20;
3. Why does the Court find the Judiciary Act of 1789 unconstitutional?&#x20;
4. How does the Court justify judicial review of legislative acts?

### Marbury v. Madison

Marbury (plaintiff) was appointed a Justice of the Peace by John Adams. However, Thomas Jefferson refused to finalize Adams's judicial appointments. Jefferson directed his Secretary of State, James Madison (defendant), not to deliver the commissions. Marbury sought a writ of mandamus to compel Madison to deliver the commission and finalize the appointment.

Mandamus = an order to a government official compelling that official to perform an act the officer is legally obligated to perform.

> If both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law: the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.&#x20;

### Rules

{% hint style="success" %}
* The Supreme Court may review executive actions and legislative acts to determine whether they comply with the United States Constitution.
* Article III is the ceiling of federal court jurisdiction. Congress cannot expand the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
{% endhint %}

### Holdings

Although the writ of mandamus sought by Marbury was an appropriate remedy under Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, that act is unconstitutional, because it would expand the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction.

Therefore, the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over Marbury’s claim.
