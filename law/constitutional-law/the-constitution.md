## 10th Amendment Limitations on Congress's Authority

### NY v US

**Holding and Reasoning (O’Connor, J.)**

Congress may not compel states to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.There are two ways Congress may urge a state to adopt a legislative program consistent with federal interests: (1) as part of its spending powers, Congress may attach conditions on states’ receipt of federal funds, or (2) where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause, Congress may offer states the choice of regulating that same activity according to federal regulations or having state law preempted by federal regulations. These options allow states to decline compliance with federal regulatory standards if state citizens decide a federal policy is contrary to local interests.

**Concurrence/Dissent (White, J.)**

The Act does not violate the Tenth Amendment because it represents a compromise worked out between and among the states with Congress as a referee.

**Concurrence/Dissent (Stevens, J.)**

The federal government already regulates state actions in the administration of various environmental programs, public services, military drafts, and a host of other state functions. No distinction exists between Congress’s ability to regulate these programs according to federal standards and its ability to enforce federal standards for the disposition of low-level radioactive waste.
