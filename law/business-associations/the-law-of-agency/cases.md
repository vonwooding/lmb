## Castillo v. Case Farms of Ohio, Inc.

(Case Farms) (defendant) was a chicken-processing plant in Ohio. Human Resources and Corporate Development Director for Case Farms, reached out to America’s Tempcorps (Tempcorps) to hire temporary employees for Case Farms.&#x20;

Tempcorps made representations to the recruits about the housing conditions Case Farms would provide in Ohio. Tempcorps gave the recruits a free bus ticket to Ohio and $20 to cover other travel expenses. When the recruits arrived in Ohio they were placed in bare houses or apartments, slept on the floor, and in some instances shared the home with 17 other recruits. Many recruits encountered cockroaches and rats. The recruits were transported to and from work in overcrowded vans with wooden boards instead of seats.

The recruits alleged that the terms and conditions of employment in Ohio substantially differed from the promises Tempcorps made when Tempcorps hired the recruits. To support their claim, the recruits relied on a theory of agency, arguing that an agency relationship existed between Case Farms and Tempcorps.

### Issue

If a principal gives an agent express authority to undertake a task, does the authority also include the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise the express authority?

### Holding and Reasoning

Yes. If a principal gives an agent express authority to undertake a task, the authority also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise the express authority. A principal may be found liable for the acts of its agent if an agency relationship exists.

Case Farms hired Tempcorps to recruit and hire workers for Case Farms’s Ohio plant. This created an express agency relationship between Tempcorps and Case Farms. The express authority to recruit and hire workers for Case Farms also includes the implied authority to do all things that would be proper, usual, and necessary to exercise the express authority. Housing and transportation are necessary components of the Case Farms recruitment process. Therefore, Tempcorps’s representations regarding housing and transportation were within the scope of Tempcorps’s relationship with Case Farms.



## Cefaratti v. Aranow

Jonathan Aranow conducted gastric bypass surgery on Lisa Cefaratti (plaintiff) at Middlesex Hospital (defendant). Aranow left a surgical sponge in Cefaratti’s stomach during the surgery. Cefaratti sued Middlesex on the ground that it was vicariously liable for Aranow’s tort. The trial court granted Middlesex summary judgment on the ground that the State of Connecticut did not recognize the doctrine of apparent authority in tort actions. The court of appeals affirmed. The Connecticut Supreme Court granted Cefaratti’s petition for certification to appeal.

### Issue

Does the doctrine of apparent agency apply to tort actions?

### Holding and Reasoning

Yes. The doctrine of apparent agency applies to tort actions. A plaintiff may establish **apparent agency** in two ways, depending on whether the plaintiff or the principal chose the agent actually engaging in the alleged tortious conduct.&#x20;

**First, a plaintiff may establish apparent agency by demonstrating that: **

(1) the principal held itself out as offering the relevant services, (2) the plaintiff chose the principal due to the principal so holding itself out, and (3) the plaintiff relied on the principal to choose the agent performing the services.&#x20;

**Alternatively, a plaintiff may establish apparent agency by demonstrating that: **

(1) the principal held out the particular agent as having authority to provide the services, (2) the plaintiff knew of the principal’s representations, and (3) the plaintiff detrimentally relied on the principal’s representations in that the plaintiff would not have chosen the service provider if she had known that the service provider was not the principal’s agent.

In this case, the court has adopted these alternative standards for the first time in this state. Cefaratti chose Aranow to perform her surgery, as opposed to Middlesex choosing Aranow for Cefaratti. Cefaratti probably would have chosen Aranow even if she had known that Aranow was not Middlesex’s agent. However, given that the apparent-authority standards laid out above are new, Cefaratti deserves the chance to prove her case at the trial level.
