# Agency

## Overview

To prove an agency relationship, the following facts must be found: "(1) a manifestation by the principal that the agent will act for him, (2) acceptance by the agent of the undertaking, and (3) an agreement between the parties that the principal will be in control of the undertaking."

Restatement (Third) of Agency

## **Yost v. Wabash College**

### **Facts**

Yost was a pledge at the Indiana Gamma Chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity at Wabash College. Yost sustained injuries in a hazing incident. Yost sued Wabash College, the local chapter of the fraternity, and the national fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, Inc. for his personal injuries. Both Wabash and the national fraternity prohibited hazing.

### Issue

Can Yost establish agency between Wabash, the national fraternity, and the local chapter?

### Rule of Law

No. Wabash and the national Fraternity cannot be held vicariously liable for conduct at the local chapter’s house. The local chapter is not a principal of Wabash or the national fraternity. Tenenat-landlord relationship does not typically create agency. Simple consent to governance without more is not sufficient to establish an agency relationship Yost was the principal of a "pledge father" and participating in local traditions led by the local chapter when he was injured.&#x20;

Yost's remedy is limited to the local chapter. Granting summary judgment in favor of the local chapter was an error.&#x20;

## **United States v. Bonds**

### Facts

The [Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay\_Area\_Laboratory\_Co-operative) (BALCO)  laboratory supplied anabolic steroids to professional athletes. The BALCO scandal was a scandal involving the use of those banned PEDs by professional athletes.&#x20;

The federal investigation of BALCO began in 2002 in conjunction with a covert USADA investigation. Of 550 existing samples, 20 professional athletes failed for THG and were subsequently incriminated in the investigation. In 2003, Bonds swore under oath he had not taken performance enhancing drugs, so the government is now prosecuting him for perjury (later, obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503).&#x20;

To succeed, it must prove the tested samples BALCO recorded actually came from Barry Bonds. The government wanted to introduce witness testimony claiming that Greg Anderson affirmed that each blood/urine sample indeed came from Bonds, in order to provide the link to Bonds.&#x20;

Bonds argued that Anderson's statements were inadmisssable hearsay. The government countered that Anderson’s statements were admissible as statements of an agent under FRE 801(d)(2)(D).

### Issue

Whether Anderson's statements are admissible as **statements of an agent** under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

### Rule of Law

801(d)(2)(d) addresses statements by the party’s agent concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.&#x20;

For example, a truck driver gets into an accident and is found to be intoxicated. While at the scene he says_“I shouldn’t have had that third beer before work.” _This statement can be offered against the employer to prove liability under the doctrine of “Apparent Authority”.

Unlike employees, independent contractors are not ordinarily agents. Mere evidence of an independent contractor relationship is insufficient in itself to establish an agency relationship.** But an independent contractor may be an agent in limited circumstances where it acts “subject to the principal’s overall control and direction.”**

### Factors

1. **the extent of control exerted by the employer ("essential ingredient")**
2. whether the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation
3. whether the work is normally done under the supervision of an employer
4. the skill required
5. whether the employer supplies tools and instrumentalities
6. the length of time employed
7. whether payment is by time or by the job
8. whether the work is in the regular business of the employer
9. the subjective intent of the parties
10. whether the employer is or is not in business

Anderson exerted considerable control over Bonds' training program. It was Anderson who proposed to Bonds that he have his blood and urine tested. Bonds provided Anderson no guidance or direction in terms of what specific tests BALCO would run on the samples. The testing was performed on Anderson’s own initiative and not at the request of Bonds.&#x20;

Anderson was not an agent for the limited purpose of the drug testing. Accordingly, his statements are inadmissible hearsay.

## **Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities / ABC, Inc.**

### Duty of Loyalty

Violations:

1. Competition
2. Misappropriation
3. Breach of Confidence

## Principal-Agent Relationship

To form an agency relationship, both the principal and the agent must manifest assent to the principal’s right to control the agent. A principal legally appoints an agent to act on their behalf and in their best interest. A principal-agent relationship may be expressed clearly through a written contract or implied through actions. Agency creates in the agent a fiduciary duty (duty of loyalty) to the principal, and vice versa.

* Asking an investment advisor to diversify a portfolio of stocks&#x20;
* Hiring an attorney for legal work
* Hiring a contractor to complete a repair on a home

## Agency and Duty&#x20;

#### **Agent Duties**

In a principal-agent relationship, counterparty interests become aligned. An agent should not have a conflict of interest in carrying out the act of a principal. Agents may not intentionally or negligently complete the task in an improper manner. Agents owe a duty of indemnification.

#### Principal Duties

A principal must give clear instructions to the agent. A principal may not place himself in a position that creates or encourages a conflict of interest.&#x20;

## Principal-Agent Problem

The principal-agent problem is a conflict of interest of priority between principal and agent. The agent generally has more information.

The risk that the agent will act in a way that is contrary to the principal’s best interest can be defined as [**agency costs**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencycosts.asp). Agency costs are caused by the separation of ownership and control. A principal delegates a degree of control and the right to make decisions to the agent, while retaining ownership of the assets and the liability for any losses.&#x20;

#### Solution

Agents can clarify expecataions and monitor results to avoid this problem. For example, shareholders can write a CEO's contract in a way that aligns counterparty incentives by directly linking pay to stock price. Perhaps they also could hire a neutral third party like a monitor or auditor, to track results.&#x20;

Employment contracts are trending towards performance based incentive structures such as performance- based stock, stock options, and profit-sharing plans.

### Funds

Assets from many investors (principals) comprise the fund. The fund manager (agent) implements an [**investment strategy**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp) to maximize profit in accordance with the** **[**risk threshhold**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp) stated in the fund's [**prospectus**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp).

## Direct v. Vicarious Liability&#x20;

Vicarious liability is a legal fiction by which a court can hold a party legally responsible for the negligence of another, not because the party did anything wrong but rather because of the party's relationship to the wrongdoer.

## Termination

Actual Authority is terminated upon the agent's or principal's death or incapacitation, completion of the agency's purpose, stc. Apparent authority ends when it is no longer reasonable for the thrid party with whom an agent deals to believe that the agent continues to act with actual authority.&#x20;
