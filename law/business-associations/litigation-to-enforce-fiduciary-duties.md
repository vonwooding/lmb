# Fiduciary Obligations

## Corporate Directors' Fiduciary Duties

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Care " %}
The duty of care is concerned with the manner in which directors make decisions. It requires directors to (1) make informed decisions and (2) actively attend to oversight of the corporation’s business and affairs. _**MBCA § 8.30  **_

The mere fact that a director breached the duty of care is not enough to hold a director liable. A director is liable only if the breach of the duty of care **actually and proximately caused **harm to the corporation or its shareholders.&#x20;

###

### Duty to Make Informed Decisions

MBCA § 8.30

> "reasonable, proactive steps to become adequately informed"
>
> "sufficiently familiar with the surrounding facts and other context"
>
> "attending and actively participating and paying attention in meetings"
>
> "reviewing information from and consulting with officers, employees, other directors, and third-party professionals like lawyers or accountants"
>
> "reviewing industry studies, market research, outside publications, and engaging in private research"

###

### Duty to Exercise Attentive Oversight

MBCA § 8.30

> "take reasonable steps to identify and address problems, shortcomings, and inadequacies"
>
> "actively and consistently monitor the corporation and participate in its affairs"
>
> "notify the board when something is going wrong"

###

### Prerogative to Rely on Information from Others

MBCA § 8.30(d)-(f)

> "may reasonably rely on director committees and on the corporation’s officers, managers, and employees to perform their duties and to provide trustworthy information, reports, opinions, and assertions"
>
> "must reasonably believe that the particular employee is reliable and competent or that the committee deserves confidence"
>
> "may rely on information, reports, opinions, and assertions by third-party professionals, such as lawyers and accountants" (unless that reliance is unwarranted)

###

### Business-Judgment Rule

The business-judgment rule may insulate a director from liability for some breaches of the duty of care (but not the duty of loyalty).&#x20;

> "The business-judgment rule creates a rebuttable presumption that the corporate directors acted (1) in good faith, (2) upon reasonable information, and (3) in the honest belief that the act was in the corporation's best interests."
>
> "a director will not be liable for honest mistakes or simple poor judgment, even if the result is catastrophic for the corporation and its shareholders"
>
> "If the plaintiff can prove that the director acted in [gross negligence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gross\_negligence) or [bad faith](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bad\_faith), then the court will not uphold the business judgment presumption."&#x20;
>
> "If the plaintiff can prove that the director had a [conflict of interest](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conflict\_of\_interest), then the court will not uphold the business judgment presumption"
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Disclosure and Candor" %}
_**T**_The duty of candor requires directors to disclose all known, material facts when seeking shareholder approval of a transaction. Unless that disclosure would violate a superior legal obligation, such as a professional duty of confidentiality.&#x20;

_**MBCA § 8.30(c)**_

_****_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Loyalty" %}
The duty of loyalty requires that corporate directors put the interests of the corporation and its shareholders ahead of their personal interests or those of any single shareholder, group of shareholders, or third party. Directors can fulfill the duty of loyalty by acting honestly and in good faith, and by avoiding conflict of interest transactions.&#x20;



### Conflicting-Interest Transactions

MBCA § 8.60

> "A conflict of interest could arise when (1) the director is a party to the transaction, (2) the director has a material financial interest in the transaction, or (3) the director knows that a related person either is a party or has a material financial interest in the transaction."
>
> " A material financial interest is (1) a pecuniary interest (as opposed to an emotional or sentimental one) that (2) one could reasonably expect to impair or influence the director’s objective judgment regarding the transaction."

###

### Competing with the Corporation

> "The director competes with the corporation if the director actively engages in a rival business or seeks to siphon customers or goodwill from the corporation."
>
> "Competition may be permitted (1) there is no reasonably foreseeable resulting harm to the corporation, or (2) any reasonably foreseeable resulting harm is outweighed by the reasonably foreseeable benefit to the corporation from allowing the competition."

###

### Validating Conflicting-Interest Transactions

MBCA § 8.61(b)

> "A director may escape liability for a conflicting-interest transaction if (1) the board of directors properly approves it, (2) the shareholders properly approve it, or (3) it is objectively fair to the corporation."
>
> "A director is not liable for a conflicting-interest transaction if the board has approved the transaction, unless the transaction was fraudulent or misrepresented by the director with the conflicting interest." MBCA§ 8.62(a)

## Shareholder v. Stakeholder

{% embed url="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2003/07/b966946aae.pdf" %}

Several basic fiduciary duty rules govern the conduct of directors of Delaware corporations. If these rules are understood and followed, directors should be able to avoid fiduciary duty breaches and protect themselves from exposure to potential liability. Fiduciary rules and available protections, discussed below, encompass:&#x20;

* the basic fiduciary duties (care and loyalty, including good faith, oversight and disclosure),
  * there is no private shareholder right of action for a violation of the [duty of good faith](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/duty\_of\_good\_faith), its violation may also raise a claim under the[ duty of loyalty.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/duty\_of\_loyalty)
* key director attributes (independence and disinterestedness, and appreciation of “red flags”),
* the importance of process (asking the right questions and keeping a good record),
* the core standard for judging director conduct (the business judgment rule), and
* key Delaware law protections (including good faith reliance on others and exculpatory charter provisions).

## Director “Rules of the Road” for Satisfying Fiduciary Duties

* Be well-advised, including as to all of the rules of the road.
* Be satisfied as to the disinterestedness and independence of each director (including yourself) as well as management and advisers, and how to respond appropriately to identified issues.
* Be comfortable with the process, including timing, board involvement and record-keeping.
* Be properly informed—ask questions, examine assumptions, and gather and review all material information reasonably available.
* Understand and follow the rules permitting reliance on management and third parties.
* Examine the premises of the proposed action, including the benefits and risks, and understand and weigh the alternatives.
* Act in good faith to do what you honestly believe is in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders collectively.
* Keep up with evolving external demands and expectations regarding board conduct—_e.g._, whether and how to address ESG (environmental, social and governance) and other non-stockholder constituency interests; director performance of their “oversight” duty (implementing reasonable company risk monitoring systems and sensitivity to “red flags” signaling noncompliance).
* Keep confidential information confidential.
