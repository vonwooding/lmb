# Partnerships

## Uniform Partnership Act (UPA)

1914

Partnership is a separate entity, but generally confused throughout.

## Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA)

1997

## General Partnership

A general partner is an owner of a partnership. Often, a general partner either plays an active role in the company's daily operations or is a managing partner.

A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners in a business for profit. A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners. The association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners in a busness for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.&#x20;

#### Not a partnership

Joint tennancies, sharing of gross returns, lender/creditor to borrower/debtor, independent contractor, employee relationship, landlord/tenant.&#x20;

### Fiduciary Duty

Partnership agreement may not eliminate the duty of loyalty but the parties may freely define the parameters of the agreement so long as the agreement purports with UPA and RUPA standards.&#x20;

#### Modification by Agreement

#### Breach and Damages

### Financial Rights

#### Contributions and Capital Accounts

Forms of contribution (capital)

Distinguishable from compensation

Partnership owns everything and partners only have access to their capital account.&#x20;

#### Loans from Partners

Partners may make loans to the partnership as a creditor. In that scenario, loan interests are separate and apart from capital.&#x20;

#### Distributions

Default rule: partners are only entitled to distributions when the business has been shut down. Often ends in dissolution if not the defaut result.

#### Partnership Property

#### Partnership Taxation&#x20;

Partnerships are pass through entities. For fed income tax, all profits and losses are taxed individually to the partners. Partnerships do not pay fed income tax although they might pay state taxes. A partner may be paying tax on money they have never seen.&#x20;

### Partnership Liability

A and M are general partners. A negligently injurs L. If L brings a lawsuit, who can she name as a party and which claims should she reaist to have the greatest chance of recovery against the most people?&#x20;

1. An actor is always liable to a third party for their own tortious conduct.
2. A partnership is liabile for injury caused to a person or for a penalty incurred as a result of a wrongful act or omission of a partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership, or with authority of the partnership.
3. All partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

But a judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner's asssets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.&#x20;

Similarly, a judgment creditoy may not levy execution against the assets of the partner to satisf a judgment based on a claim against the partnership... **unless** a judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.

### Dissolution

A dissolution agreement sets out the termination terms to which youâ€™ve agreed and can provide clarity on issues which may help prevent any future misunderstanding.

1. Trigger - dissociation
2. Consequence
   1. Business not wound up&#x20;
   2. Dissolution - winding up- termination
3. Resolution
   1. Buy out
   2. Liquidation and Termination

### Dissociation

The partner: becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; executing an assignment for the benefits of creditors; appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator.&#x20;

Individual partner: death; appointment of a guardian or general conservator; judicial determination that the partner has otherwise become incapable of performing the partner's duties under the partnerhsip agreement.&#x20;

#### Wrongful Dissociation

Partners may be liable for damages under wrongful dissociation.

## Limited Partnership

A limited partner, also known as a silent partner, has limited liability for the company's liabilities and debts.

* A limited partner can contribute financially to the business in exchange for a percentage of the partnership's profits.
* A limited partner cannot incur the debts or obligations of the partnership in excess of the amount of capital invested into the business.
* A limited partner need not participate in the daily operations of the business or in management meetings.
* If a limited partner works in excess of 500 hours in a given year, he or she may be deemed a general partner. This can be an advantage for a limited partner who wishes to have more of a say in the company's growth and development.
