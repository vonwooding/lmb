## Formation

In 1985, Houston Natural Gas (a retail gas and oil company) merged with InterNorth, Inc. (specializing in pipelines,  plastics, coal and petroleum exploration and production) to form **Enron Corporation, an** American [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy\_development), [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), and services company.&#x20;

The CEO of Houston Natural Gas, Ken Lay, assumed the role as CEO of the Enron conglomerate. In 1990, Lay hired Jeff Skilling, a partner at Mckenzie and Company - the consulting company which advised Enron. Skilling became CEO of Enron Finance Corporation and hired Andrew Fastow, a financier who had worked extensively with asset-backed securities.&#x20;

In under ten years, Enron became the 7th largest company in the U.S. and the single largest financial contributor to George Bush's presidential campaign. Shares of Enron stock increased in price from $10 in 1990 to $85 in 2000. In other words, 23.86% annualized returns for a total gain of 750%.&#x20;

## Special Purpose Entity

An SPE is a legal entity designed for a limited and specific purpose. SPEs are typically used for risk sharing, securitization, asset transfers, and financing.&#x20;

SPEs are orphan companies that should not be majority-owned by the sponsor company. Doing so defeats the purpose of the SPE. If the sponsor and SPE are not separate then the SPE must be consolidated with the rest of the bank's group for regulatory, accounting, and bankruptcy purposes.&#x20;

### **Incognito Leverage**

**Incognito leverage** is debt or financing activity not on the company's [balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance\_sheet). For example, the financial obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries such as an SPE may be off-balance sheet, but only when the subsidiaries are not wholly owned by the sponsor. Another example can be seen with securitized loans, which are not represented on the balance sheet, because securitization involves selling the loans to a third party.&#x20;

Interestingly, Fastow had considerable experience working with asset-backed securities which provide an obvious advantage for a bank by allowing it to move assets off the bank's balance sheet while creating revenue.

## Mark to Market Accounting&#x20;

The SEC approved the Mark to Market (MTM) accounting technique in 1992. MTM (as opposed to historical cost accounting) permits firms to report the fair market value of an asset rather than the original purchase cost.

But problems can arise when the market-based measurement does not accurately reflect the underlying asset's true value. In particular, if the asset has low [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), (as the vast majority of Enron's assets were at this time) the current selling price of a bank's assets could be much lower than the actual value. This results in inflated reports of revenue growtn, debt/equity ratio and increased support from investors causing the stock price to rise.&#x20;
