# Authority

## Types of Authority

### Actual authority

Actual authority refers to the power that the principal specifically granted to the agent to act or that the agent **reasonably believes, in accordance with the principal's manifestation,** was authorized by the principal. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.01. Actual authority may be express or implied.

#### Express

Any power specifically granted by the principal to the agent, whether orally or in writing. This is construed according to a reasonable person standard. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02.

#### Implied

Power granted by the principal to the agent through the principal’s conduct, rather than through an express oral or written statement.&#x20;

1. An agent has implied authority to take any action “necessary or incidental to achieving the principal's objectives.” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02.&#x20;
2. An agent may have implied authority to act in accordance with industry customs and practices.&#x20;
3. An agent has implied authority to continue to do any act that the principal has previously acquiesced to the agent doing, despite the agent not having actual authority to engage in the activity.
4. An agent has implied authority to act reasonably in the event of an emergency. (Sometimes called an agent of necessity).

### Apparent Authority

Apparent authority is power created in an agent **or other party** as a result of the principal’s dealings with third parties. Apparent authority will only be created when the principal’s conduct creates a reasonable belief in the mind of the third party that the agent is authorized to act and the third party is induced to act in reliance on the principal’s conduct. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03.

### Inherent Authority

Inherent authority is power that results when an agent has been given some actual authority, which the agent goes beyond, but which justifies binding the principal in order to protect third parties.&#x20;

This is like an extension of apparent authority, but there is no requirement for the principal to have any direct dealings with the third party to give rise to inherent authority.

The Third Restatement on Agency actually does away with the concept of inherent authority, preferring to work exclusively within the framework of actual and apparent authority, and estoppel.

### Ratification - Creating Retroactive Authority

Anytime a principal later affirms, either by words or conduct, the unauthorized conduct of an agent, the act will be treated as if it were authorized when it was done. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01.&#x20;

The principal must be fully informed of all relevant facts, and a principal may not usually change the terms or partially ratify the agent’s acts. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.06.

Ratification will not be permitted if it would cause “adverse and inequitable effects on the rights of third parties.” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.05.

A principal who engages in conduct that causes others to reasonably believe he or she has ratified the agent’s conduct will not later be permitted to deny ratification if a third party has detrimentally relied on the ratification. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.08.

## Types of Agent

A universal Agent is empowered to engage in any and all activities, of any type, on behalf of the principal. This type of agency is quite rare.

A general agent is authorized to engage in a series of transactions or all transactions of a particular type, sometimes for a continuous, ongoing period.

A special agent is an agent authorized to engage in a single transaction or a time-limited series of transactions.

## Termination of Authority

An agent’s actual authority will terminate upon the death of the agent or the principal, the principal’s loss of capacity, upon the purpose of the agency being completed, as agreed to by the parties, a change of circumstances, revocation or renunciation, or by operation of law.

#### Termination of actual authority does not necessarily end apparent authority.

Apparent authority ends when it is no longer reasonable for the third party with whom and agent deals to believe that the agent continues to act with actual authority.&#x20;
