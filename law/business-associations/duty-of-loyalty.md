# Duty of Loyalty

## Duties of Loyalty

An agent must be loyal to the principal in anything touching the subject of the agency relationship. The essence of that duty (and of the fiduciary relationship itself) is that if the agent’s and principal’s interests ever conflict, and the conflict implicates the agency, then the agent must subordinate her own interests to the principal’s.&#x20;

\[See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.01, with comments.]

### Duty to Avoid Dealing with Principal as an Adverse Party

The duty of loyalty prohibits the agent from dealing with the principal as an adverse party, or on behalf of an adverse party, in any transaction related to the agency relationship. This means the agent typically may not deal with the principal on the agent’s own account in a matter touching the agency, nor may she serve multiple principals with adverse interests in the same transaction. The agent must not hold a substantial stake in a party adverse to the principal. The agent’s close relatives may not deal with the principal as an adverse party.&#x20;

\[See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.03.]

### Duty to Avoid Competing with the Principal

The agent’s duty to avoid competing with the principal requires an agent to avoid competing with the principal’s business. During the agency relationship, the agent must not compete with the principal, act on behalf of a competitor of the principal, assist a competitor, (e.g., by selling to a competitor), or hold a substantial stake in a competitor. This duty is a subset of the larger duty not to treat the principal as an adverse party.&#x20;

\[See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.04, with comments.]

### Competing Once the Agency Terminates

Subject to any valid noncompete agreement with the principal, an agent may freely compete with the principal once the agency terminates. Also, it is not a breach of duty for an agent to use skills and expertise acquired during the agency to compete with the principal after the agency. During the agency, the agent may typically prepare to compete with the principal after the agency and need not disclose the preparation to the principal, as long as the preparation itself is not be wrongful. Determining whether preparation to compete is wrongful in a given case is very difficult and fact-intensive. Generally, preparation is wrongful if it (1) is a tort or an independent breach of fiduciary duty (e.g., using the principal’s own resources or confidential information to prepare to compete), or (2) it crosses the line from mere preparation to overt competition (e.g., soliciting customers or recruiting the principal’s employees to work for the agent’s upcoming competitive enterprise).&#x20;

\[See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.04, with comments.]

### Using the Principal’s Property or Confidential Information

An agent must not use the principal’s property for purposes personal to the agent or a third party. Similarly, an agent generally must not use or communicate the principal’s confidential information for purposes personal to the agent or a third party. These acts violate the duty of loyalty regardless of whether the principal is harmed, or whether the agent profits from them.&#x20;

\[Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.05, with comments.]

#### Confidential Information Defined

Information is confidential if the agent should reasonably expect that the principal wishes the information to be kept private. For example, a trade secret, customer list, or similar piece of information that affords the principle some commercial advantage in the marketplace (and, hence, would afford competitors an advantage if they obtained it). Usually, an agent must keep this information confidential and not exploit it even after the agency relationship terminates.&#x20;

\[See Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.05 cmt. c.]

### Principal’s Consent to Breach of Duty of Loyalty

A principal’s effective consent may absolve what would otherwise be the agent’s breach of the duty of loyalty. In obtaining the principal’s consent, the agent must: (1) act in good faith; (2) disclose all material facts that, to a reasonable person in the agent’s position, could foreseeably affect the principal’s judgment, provided the agent knows, should know, or has reason to know of them; and (3) deal fairly with the principal.

The consent must concern a **specific act, transaction, or series of acts or transactions** that one could reasonably expect to arise in the agency relationship. Broad grants of consent to breach the duty of loyalty are ineffective.

### Obedience

The duty of obedience requires the agent to: (1) act solely within the scope of the agent’s actual authority, (2) comply with the principal’s lawful instructions in all acts or transactions on the principal’s behalf, and (3) abide the terms of any contract with the principal.
