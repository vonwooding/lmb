Several basic fiduciary duty rules govern the conduct of directors of Delaware corporations. If these rules are understood and followed, directors should be able to avoid fiduciary duty breaches and protect themselves from exposure to potential liability. Fiduciary rules and available protections, discussed below, encompass:&#x20;

* the basic fiduciary duties (care and loyalty, including good faith, oversight and disclosure),
  * there is no private shareholder right of action for a violation of the [duty of good faith](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/duty\_of\_good\_faith), its violation may also raise a claim under the[ duty of loyalty.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/duty\_of\_loyalty)
* key director attributes (independence and disinterestedness, and appreciation of “red flags”),
* the importance of process (asking the right questions and keeping a good record),
* the core standard for judging director conduct (the business judgment rule), and
* key Delaware law protections (including good faith reliance on others and exculpatory charter provisions).

## Director “Rules of the Road” for Satisfying Fiduciary Duties

* Be satisfied as to the disinterestedness and independence of each director (including yourself) as well as management and advisers, and how to respond appropriately to identified issues.
* Be comfortable with the process, including timing, board involvement and record-keeping.
* Be properly informed—ask questions, examine assumptions, and gather and review all material information reasonably available.
* Understand and follow the rules permitting reliance on management and third parties.
* Examine the premises of the proposed action, including the benefits and risks, and understand and weigh the alternatives.
* Act in good faith to do what you honestly believe is in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders collectively.
* Keep up with evolving external demands and expectations regarding board conduct—_e.g._, whether and how to address ESG (environmental, social and governance) and other non-stockholder constituency interests; director performance of their “oversight” duty (implementing reasonable company risk monitoring systems and sensitivity to “red flags” signaling noncompliance).
* Keep confidential information confidential.
