# Statutory Interpretation and Construction

## West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey

### Textualism

West Virginia University Hospitals V. Casey uses textualist tools, such as surveying other statutes, to confirm that attorney's fees don't include expert fees. The meaning of a term used by Congress may be determined by looking to other statutes that use the same term.

### Scalia (Majority)

The meaning of a term used by Congress may be determined by looking to other statutes that use the same term. Here, 42 U.S.C. § 1988 does not define attorney’s fees. However, many other statutes permit awards of attorney’s fees or expert services. The standard usage of the term in these statutes shows that expert-witness fees are distinct expenses not included within the ordinary meaning of attorney’s fees. In this case, WVUH is not entitled to expert-witness fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which only mentions attorney’s fees

### Stevens (Dissent)

Attorney’s fees have previously been interpreted to include fees for the services of paralegals and law clerks. There is no reason to distinguish between these types of services and the services of expert witnesses. The legislative history of the statute refers to several cases that approved the award of expert-witness fees as attorney’s fees. The intent of Congress should be taken into consideration when interpreting the statutory text of 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

## Tennesee Valley Authority v. Hill

### Purposivism

Hill and other Tennessee residents (plaintiffs) filed suit in federal district court against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (defendant), a wholly-owned public corporation of the United States, seeking to enjoin construction of a nearly-completed dam and reservoir on the Little Tennessee River. Plaintiffs alleged the project failed to conform to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Secretary of the Interior found that once the dam and reservoir were operational, it would result in the “total destruction of the snail darter’s habitat.” Under § 7 of the ESA, all federal agencies were required to protect the snail darter’s critical habitat area. Plaintiffs then filed suit against the TVA to enjoin the final completion of the dam and reservoir on the ground that it could result in the extinction of the snail darter.

### Rule of Law

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species or result in destruction or modification of the species’ habitat.

### **Holding and Reasoning (Burger, C.J.)**

§ 7 clearly provides that federal agencies must ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species or result in destruction or modification of habitat of such species.\*\* \*\*

TVA argues that the ESA cannot reasonably be interpreted as applying to a federal project that was well underway when Congress passed the statute. The TVA claims that millions of dollars and substantial work hours have been devoted to completion of the dam and reservoir and halting the project now would be unjust.

Although the TVA’s arguments are valid, an examination of the ESA’s legislative history and structure of the law indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities and that their value is “incalculable.”

### **Dissent (Powell, J.)**

The Court has a duty to construe statutes in a way that is consistent with common sense and the public good.\*\* \*\*It is not reasonable to interpret § 7 as applying to federal projects that are already completed or substantially completed when the threat to an endangered species is discovered.

It is possible to construe § 7 in a reasonable way as applicable only to prospective agency actions. That more limited construction is supported by the legislative history of § 7 and is consistent with the presumption against construing statutes to give them retroactive effect.

The Court's holding in **Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States** that courts should look beyond the text of a statute to discern its meaning has been controversial.

## United Steelworkers of America v. Weber

Title VII doesn't prohibit private employers from voluntarily adopting affirmative-action plans designed to eliminate racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories. The case used legislative history to reach its controversial conclusion that Title VII permits some racially based affirmative action programs.

## King v. Burwell

(1) In extraordinary cases involving questions of deep economic and political significance, a court does not grant an administrative agency Chevron deference.

(2) The Affordable Care Act's tax credits are available in states that have exchanges established by the Department of Health and Human Services.

In extraordinary cases involving questions of deep economic and political significance, a court does not grant an administrative agency Chevron deference. Chevron deference is premised on the notion that if a statute is ambiguous, Congress intended the expert agency to fill in the gap. This notion does not apply to cases of broad national importance. In such cases, if Congress wanted to assign an agency to fill in gaps of ambiguity, it would have done so explicitly.

## Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College

### Pragmatic and Dynamic Statutory Interpretation

Whether sexual-orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination is a question of statutory interpretation. Under Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), a person can be found to be illegally discriminated against based on characteristics of the person with whom she has intimate relations. In Loving, the alleged discrimination was based on the race of the plaintiff’s partner. In this case, the alleged discrimination was based on the sex of the plaintiff’s partner. In both cases, the claim was that changing that one characteristic—race or sex—would have resulted in a different outcome. Thus, under both the comparative and associational theories, Hively’s claim is actionable under Title VII.

## Dictionaries

### Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.

A term that is undefined in a statute must be given the ordinary meaning of the term.

Here, the meaning of an interpreter is not defined in the Court Interpreters Act or any other relevant statute. The ordinary meaning of an interpreter may be determined by considering the definition of the term in the dictionaries that were in use when the statutory provision was enacted. Many of these dictionaries define an interpreter as a person who translates spoken language.

**Holding and Reasoning (Alito, J.)**

In this case, the statutory term should be construed to mean what the term is ordinarily understood to mean, even if the definition is broad enough to include another meaning of the word. All of these dictionaries include a person who translates orally within the definition of an interpreter.

**Dissent (Ginsburg, J.)**

The definitions in the relevant dictionaries show that written translation is an acceptable meaning for an interpreter, even if that meaning is not the most common usage. The decisions of federal trial courts often refer to translators of written documents as interpreters. Additionally, prior to the adoption of the Court Interpreters Act, federal trial courts routinely awarded the costs of translating written documents to the prevailing parties.

The statute was adopted in order to expand access to interpretation services. Nothing in the statute indicates an intent to eliminate these costs as a proper award to a prevailing party. The purpose of a translation service is to make relevant communication accessible to litigants and courts. This purpose is served by including written-translation services within the meaning of an interpreter for the purpose of compensation.

#### Plain-Meaning Rule

Principle of contract or statutory interpretation that requires a court to determine the meaning of a provision that is clear and unambiguous on its face from the ordinary definitions and usage of the language, without looking to extrinsic evidence to aid in construction.

## Nix v. Hedden

When interpreting a statute, a court should use the ordinary, rather than specialized, meaning of the statute’s words.

**Holding and Reasoning (Gray, J.)**

Although words may have different meanings in different communities, a court should assume that statutes are written in the language of ordinary people. Here, the vegetables taxed under the Act would commonly be understood to include tomatoes. While a tomato is botanically a fruit, ordinary people refer to tomatoes as vegetables. Tomatoes are eaten at dinner, like other vegetables. Fruits are eaten for dessert. Fruits and vegetables do not have any special meaning in the lexicon of trade and commerce. Consequently, tomatoes are vegetables for purposes of the Act, and Hedden therefore properly charged duties on Nix’s tomatoes.

## Yates v. United States

The term “tangible object” in § 1519 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act refers to an object used to record or preserve information and does not include fish.

The bill, which contains eleven sections, was enacted as a reaction to a number of major [corporate and accounting scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting\_scandals), including [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron\_scandal) and [WorldCom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCom\_scandal). The sections of the bill cover responsibilities of a public corporation's board of directors, add criminal penalties for certain misconduct, and require the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_Securities\_and\_Exchange\_Commission) to create regulations to define how public corporations are to comply with the law.

**Holding and Reasoning (Ginsburg, J.)**

In this case, the government concedes that the Act was intended to prohibit corporations from shredding documents to hide financial wrongdoing, but maintains that § 1519 is broad enough to encompass Yates’s conduct. The term “tangible object” as used in § 1519 of the Act applies to financial documents and records and not to fish, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

**Concurrence (Alito, J.)**

The inclusion of the verb phrase "makes a false entry in" makes clear that § 1519 was not intended to apply to fish or fishing. It is unclear how someone could make a false entry in a fish. Rather, this phrase appears to apply exclusively to the filekeeping context.

**Dissent (Kagan, J.)**

The ordinary meaning of "tangible object" is something discrete with a physical form. As a fish is a discrete thing with a physical form, a fish is a tangible object.\*\* \*\*A fisherman who dumps undersized fish in order to avoid a fine should be treated the same as a fisherman who shreds his vessel's catch log to avoid a fine, as one is no less blameworthy than the other. In enacting § 1519, Congress understood that destroying tangible evidence falls within the purview of the Act regardless of the form the object takes.

## Lockhart v. United States

A limiting clause or phrase should be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows, unless such an interpretation is overcome by other indicia of meaning.

**Holding and Reasoning (Sotomayor, J.)**

Structural or contextual evidence may rebut the last antecedent inference. In this case, the context of the statute at issue fortifies the interpretation expected under the rule. The language of the statute parallels the pattern of another statute in which sexual abuse of a minor is a distinct offense from aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse. If Congress had intended to limit each crime in this statute to conduct involving a minor, it is unlikely that Congress would have so closely followed the language of the other statute.

### Cannons of Construction

Common rules:

1. Expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another
2. A term is known by its associates
3. A general term is interpreted to include things of the same type as the more specific listed examples
4. Provisions are construed so that others are not rendered superfluous or redundant
5. The same word used at different places in the statute is presumed to have the same meaning
