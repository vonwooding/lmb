# Getting Started

## What Are Admin Agencies?

Administrative agencies are all of the authorities and operating units of the government **except for the constitutionally established entities in the first three Articles:** that is, except for Congress, the President and Vice President, and the Supreme Court.&#x20;

The term agencies is used because these entities are **agents** of the constitutionally-established **principals**. As **agents**, they carry out tasks for their **principals**.&#x20;

## What Is Admin Law?

Admin law is a body of general principles _as distinguished_ from the particular substantive law that a specific admin agency deals with.&#x20;

### Materials Developed or Issued by Admin Agencies

### Executive Agencies

FFA

EPA

### Independent Regulatory Commissions and Boards

[Full List](https://www.acus.gov/agencies/independent-regulatory-agencies)

Typically narrow and technical

### Partially Federal Entities

Public-private entities like government corporations, federal-state organizations like those established under the Compact Clause, and federal-foreign institutions like those created by treaties.

## Organization and Structure

The Constitution says very little about the details of the structure of the federal government.  Each agency is organized by statue **(organic statue)** or by presidential directive **(founding memorandum)**.

## Functions and Activities

Agencies provide benefits, generate information, issue licenses, promulgate rules that govern private conduct, enforce federal law, adjudicate disputes, develop and operate infrastructure, award grants and contracts, manage their internal administration, and much more.

### Regulations

Agency regulations are first published in the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/current) and eventually codified in the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov).

## Statutory Interpretation

### The Legislative Process

The constitution mandates some federal statutes that govern administrative agencies. The House and Senate establish the rest. Notably, Section 7 does not mention congressional committees.&#x20;

Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution sets out the basic legislative process:

1. The bill must be introduced by a member of either chamber, and may be "sponsored."
2. The bill is referred to a Congressional committee with jurisdiction for further consideration.&#x20;
3. The bill may be referred to a specialized subcommittee for initial consideration.
4. Conduct hearings to discuss the bill.&#x20;
5. Mark up sessions: The bill may be rewritten, amended, rejected, or reported to the full chamber for consideration.
6. The bill is scheduled for floor consideration.&#x20;
7. The bill must be passed with identical language by each chamber of the U.S. bicameral legislature.
8. The bill must be presented to the President.&#x20;
9. The President may sign the bill into law, or veto the bill.&#x20;
10. If vetoed, Congress can override with supermajority (2/3).

### Omnibus Bills

Omnibus bills are massive pieces of legislation combining many smaller bills.

#### Budget Reconciliation Bill

Budget reconciliation provides a fast-track process for consideration of bills to implement the policy choices embodied in the annual congressional budget resolution.

Instead of needing 60 votes, a reconciliation bill only needs a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation starts with the congressional budget resolution. The budget cannot be stalled in the Senate by filibuster, and it does not need the President’s signature.

## Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer (1952)

### Facts

In late 1951, steel mill owners and their employees had disagreements over the terms of collective bargaining agreements. The steel mill employees’ union gave notice of its intent to strike. Steel was essential for the construction of weapons and war materials and thus a strike could jeopardize national security.

Accordingly, President Truman issued Executive Order 10340, directing the **Secretary of Commerce** to take control of and continue operating most of the nation’s steel mills. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. and other steel mill operators alleged that the President’s order amounted to an exercise of lawmaking, a legislative function reserved expressly for Congress.&#x20;

### Issue

May the President of the United States, under his constitutional executive powers, issue a lawmaking order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the nation’s steel mills?&#x20;

### Rule of Law

#### Majority - No

**Black: **The President’s power to issue executive orders must come from either an act of Congress or the Constitution.

**Burton: **Congress therefore properly outlined the procedures available to the President to prevent a large-scale strike that could harm the country in the [Taft-Hartley Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley\_Act)

**Clark: **When Congress has laid down specific procedures to deal with the type of crisis confronting the President, he must follow those procedures in responding to that crisis. [Little v. Barreme (1804)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_v.\_Barreme).

**Jackson: **When the President acts in a way that is incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress (here, the Taft-Hartley Act), he may rely only on the powers expressly granted to him by the Constitution. The President is checked by the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

**Douglas: **Congress is the only branch of government that can authorize or appropriate money to pay for a program involving a nationwide seizure of property.

**Frankfurter: **The President has been given powers to seize production, transportation, communication, or storage facilities on sixteen separate occasions since 1916. However, in all prior instances, Congress granted those powers to the President in times of war or national crisis for a specific, and limited time frame.

#### Dissent - Yes

**Vinson: **The Constitution delegates to the President the duty to execute legislative programs.** **The implementation of a steel seizure program designed to preserve production and promote the national defense qualifies as a legislative program.&#x20;

The President acted in a swift and** **necessary way to prevent a crisis of national defense that could result from a lack of steel production.** **No other branch of government has the ability to act so quickly by releasing an Executive Order.

The majority’s decision is improperly aimed at “straw men” as it seeks to prevent the evils of potential future presidents.&#x20;
