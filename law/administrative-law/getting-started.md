# Overview

## What Are Admin Agencies?

Administrative agencies are all of the authorities and operating units of the government, except for Congress, the President and Vice President, and the Supreme Court.&#x20;

Administrative agencies have no independent existence. They are created, enabled, and empowered by the legislature and to a lesser extent by the executive. Sometimes, Congress creates skeletal acts and then passes the statute to the agency to determine how the technical components will be interpreted, applied, and adjudicated. Other times, the President&#x20;

An agency is created to be a repository of expertise and so the Courts tend to defer to agency interpretations and adjudications.&#x20;

We must always look for an admin agency's **source of authority. **Administrative agencies may be established by Congressional act **(organic statute)** or presidential directive **(founding memorandum).**
