# Getting Started

## What Are Admin Agencies?

Administrative agencies are all of the authorities and operating units of the government **except for the constitutionally established entities in the first three Articles:** that is, except for Congress, the President and Vice President, and the Supreme Court. Administrative agencies may be established by Congressional act **(organic statute)** or presidential directive (**founding memorandum).**

## Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer (1952)

### Facts

In late 1951, steel mill owners and their employees had disagreements over the terms of collective bargaining agreements. The steel mill employees’ union gave notice of its intent to strike. Steel was essential for the construction of weapons and war materials and thus a strike could jeopardize national security.

Accordingly, President Truman issued Executive Order 10340, directing the **Secretary of Commerce** to take control of and continue operating most of the nation’s steel mills. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. and other steel mill operators alleged that the President’s order amounted to an exercise of lawmaking, a legislative function reserved expressly for Congress.

### Issue

May the President of the United States, under his constitutional executive powers, issue a lawmaking order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the nation’s steel mills?

### Rule of Law

#### Majority - No

\*\*Black: \*\*The President’s power to issue executive orders must come from either an act of Congress or the Constitution.

\*\*Burton: \*\*Congress therefore properly outlined the procedures available to the President to prevent a large-scale strike that could harm the country in the [Taft-Hartley Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley\_Act)

\*\*Clark: \*\*When Congress has laid down specific procedures to deal with the type of crisis confronting the President, he must follow those procedures in responding to that crisis. [Little v. Barreme (1804)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_v.\_Barreme).

\*\*Jackson: \*\*When the President acts in a way that is incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress (here, the Taft-Hartley Act), he may rely only on the powers expressly granted to him by the Constitution. The President is checked by the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

\*\*Douglas: \*\*Congress is the only branch of government that can authorize or appropriate money to pay for a program involving a nationwide seizure of property.

\*\*Frankfurter: \*\*The President has been given powers to seize production, transportation, communication, or storage facilities on sixteen separate occasions since 1916. However, in all prior instances, Congress granted those powers to the President in times of war or national crisis for a specific, and limited time frame.

#### Dissent - Yes

\*\*Vinson: **The Constitution delegates to the President the duty to execute legislative programs.** \*\*The implementation of a steel seizure program designed to preserve production and promote the national defense qualifies as a legislative program.

The President acted in a swift and\*\* **necessary way to prevent a crisis of national defense that could result from a lack of steel production.** \*\*No other branch of government has the ability to act so quickly by releasing an Executive Order.

The majority’s decision is improperly aimed at “straw men” as it seeks to prevent the evils of potential future presidents.
