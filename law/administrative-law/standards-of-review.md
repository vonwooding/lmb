# Standards of Review

### Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB

#### **Rule of Law**

If a federal agency departs from its own precedent, the departure must be reasonable, and the agency must clearly set forth the grounds for such departure.

#### Facts

The National Labor Relations Act prohibited employers from threats of reprisal against union organization. One of Shaw’s agents told employees that if a union was formed, “the employees would be guaranteed minimum wages and workmen’s comp and that’s where our collective bargaining process would begin.” The National Labor Relations Board (plaintiff) found that the statement was a threat of reprisal, in violation of the act.

#### Holding and Reasoning

Here, the court declined to enforce the board’s order because the board deviated from its own precedential authority without providing an explanation. But the board in many prior instances had held that similar “bargaining from scratch” statements did not, without more, constitute threats of reprisal. In issuing its order, the board did not explain or set forth the grounds for the departure from its prior holdings. If this was a novel issue, that would be another matter.&#x20;

### Universal Camera Corp v. NLRB

#### **Rule of Law**

A court should defer to a federal agency's findings of fact if they are supported by “substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.”

In previous decisions, this Court established “substantial evidence” as the proper test for courts reviewing the NLRB’s decisions. However, this led to an assumption by courts that the standard was satisfied when the reviewing court could find in the record evidence, which, when viewed in isolation, substantiated the NLRB’s findings. Courts should not view the evidence in isolation; rather the substantiality of the evidence must take into account conflicting evidence in the record. In short, the court must review the record as a whole to determine whether there is substantial evidence.

### Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.

#### **Rule of Law**

When an agency rescinds a regulation, it must explain the evidence underlying its decision, and offer a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.

### FCC v. Fox TV Stations, Inc.&#x20;

#### **Rule of Law**

The Administrative Procedure Act generally does not require an agency to show that its new policy is preferable to the existing policy it replaces. Rather, the APA obligates the agency to acknowledge openly its change in policy direction and to prove that it has adopted the new policy for reasons that are not arbitrary or capricious. Only in special circumstances must the agency explain its preference for the new policy.&#x20;

### Citizen to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe



### Dept. of Homeland Security v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.
