# Formal and Informal Adjudication

## Constitutional Framework

Admin agencies may have an adjudicatory ARM or the admin agencies itself may be an adjudicatory BODY. Congress often dictates an admin agency's adjudication process - look at the organic statute/act and the particular substantive statute/act.\*\* \*\*

"Courts and adjudicatory bodies are fundamentally alike in that they determine controversies under the law on the baseis of evidence received in a hearing. They are different in that adjudicatory entities are generally restricted to one subject and thus they build up expertise in that subject."

Methods of adjudication authorized by Congress:

1. agency investigates and brings charge in a federal district court
2. agency arm brings the charges and another agmin agency conducts the adjudication
3. ordinary citizens enforce a statute and accompanying regulations in court, often alongside an admin agency

### **Multiplicity of Functions**

Investigates the situation, becomes convinced there was wrongdoing, votes to bring charges, prosecutes, testifies as an expert witness, acts ad the hearing examiner receiving evidence, makes findings of facts and proposed conclusions of law, hears an internal appeal, and renders the final decision.

**554(b)** Persons entitled to notice of an agency hearing

**554(c)** The agency shall give all interested parties opportunity for offers of settlement and a hearing and decision on notice in accordance with sections 556 and 557.

**555** Ancillary matters; representation and accompaniment before the admin agency; required documents for investigation; agency cubpoenas; action on various types of requests

**556** hearings, presiding employees, powers and duties, burden of proof, evidence, record as basis of decision

**557** initial decisions, conclusiveness, review by agency, submissions by parties, contents of decisions, record

### Stern v. Marshall

Although the bankruptcy court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Vickie’s counterclaim complied with 28 U.S.C. § 157(b), that provision is unconstitutional as applied in this case. Because bankruptcy courts are not Article III tribunals, they may not exercise “the judicial power of the United States.” Absent “limited circumstances” as to which a “public rights” exception applies, the bankruptcy court lacks jurisdiction to enter a final judgment.

No public rights exception is available because Vickie’s counterclaim (1) is independent of federal bankruptcy law, (2) will not necessarily be resolved through the determination of Pierce’s proof of claim, (3) is not limited to a narrow determination of facts regarding a particularized area of law, (4) did not originate in the legislative or executive branch, (5) does not derive from a federal statutory scheme, and (6) is not entirely dependent upon the adjudication of a claim created by federal law.

### Crowell v. Benson

Knudsen was a longshoreman who was injured while working on a boat for Benson. Knudsen brought a workers’ compensation claim against Benson under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 901-950 (the Act). Crowell, the workers’ compensation judge, ruled in favor of Knudsen. Benson (plaintiff) then filed suit in federal district court against Crowell (defendant), alleging the workers’ compensation court did not have jurisdiction, because Knudsen was not employed by Benson at the time of the injury.

Congress may not vest in administrative agencies the final power to determine facts that invariably determine constitutional rights. Even if Congress has bestowed fact-finding power on an administrative court, the federal courts may review facts as necessary to determine the administrative court’s jurisdiction.

The Longshoremen’s Act provides that the rulings of law of the deputy commissioner are subject to review by the federal district courts. However, the factual findings of the deputy commissioner regarding injuries to employees are final; otherwise, the purpose of administrative courts to handle cases would be defeated.

Here, the district court has the authority to determine the fact of employment, which is a condition of the operation of the statute.

### Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (defendant) opened an investigation into the pricing practices of the 74 corporate members of the Cement Institute (Cement) (plaintiff), a cement industry trade association. The FTC found that the companies’ prices over a series of years, even in sealed bids, were consistently identical, down to a fraction of a penny.

An administrative agency is not subject to disqualification from an adjudication merely because it previously expressed an opinion on the conduct at issue in the adjudication. An agency’s previous experience with a subject matter is a boon to its ability to conduct adjudications, not a negative.

### Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States

The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) required the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (defendant) to hold a hearing upon the request of any person who may be affected by a grant, amendment, or renewal of a license The AEA did not specify any required nature of the hearing. Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. (plaintiff) sued the commission, arguing that the AEA required an on-the-record hearing in accordance with the APA.

The new hearing rules (1) eliminated the discovery process in lieu of certain mandatory disclosures by parties, and (2) curtailed cross-examination to that which was necessary to the case, subject to the discretion of the presiding officer.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an agency conducting an adjudication must provide a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker and allow each party an opportunity to present its case, submit rebuttal evidence, and conduct any witness examination necessary to ensure disclosure of all relevant facts.

### Impartiality of the ALJ

#### ALJs as Agency Employees

Bandimere v. SEC ruled that ALJs working for the SEC were not just employees, but inferior officers and thus the existing sustem did not "vest the appointment in the president alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments" as reqired by the Constutiton. Divided vote - yet to be seen if this will stand.

#### Formal Ajudication without and ALJ

Some federal agencies hold formal evidentiary hearings although they are not required by the APA. At times, the agency will hold a recognizably formal proceeding in which evidence can be introduced by each side and the decision has to be based on the record so produced.

AJ v. ALJ

### Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. Federal Labor Relations Authority

The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), the exclusive bargaining representative for air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), called a nationwide strike of air traffic controllers against the FAA. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) issued a complaint of unfair labor practices against PATCO, and sought revocation of PATCO’s certification under the Civil Service Reform Act (Act).

The Act requires that FLRA unfair labor practice hearings be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to the extent practicable. Section 557(d) of the APA prohibits ex parte communications to or from interested parties in formal agency adjudications.

There are two administrative remedies for improper ex parte communications **during agency adjudication**:

(1) the violating party’s disclosure of the communication and its content; and

(2) the violating party’s showing of cause as to why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of the violation.

Improper ex parte communications, even when undisclosed in during agency proceedings, do not necessarily void an agency decision. Consider the following to determine whether ex communications render the administrative proceeding void.

## Informal Agency Adjudication Under The APA

### Dominion Energy Brayton Point, LLC v. Johnson

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (defendant) had issued a series of National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387. Dominion filed suit against the EPA in federal district court, arguing that the EPA was required to grant its request for a formal evidentiary hearing.

Under Chevron deference, the EPA has concluded that, in the absence of clear congressional intent or statutory language requiring the EPA to hold formal evidentiary hearings for NPDES permit review, informal hearings are sufficient and do not violate the Due Process Clause.

### Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp.

When deciding if a federal agency's decision is impermissibly arbitrary and capricious, as long as there are no due-process issues or specific statutory mandates, a court may not impose any procedural requirements on a federal agency that are not found in the Administrative Procedure Act. This rule, from **Vermont v. Yankee**, applies both to informal rulemaking and informal adjudications by a federal agency.

Federal agencies are not bound to implement procedures based on notions of general fundamental fairness; only statutory requirements are applicable. ERISA, the applicable governing statute, does not require the PBGC to follow any specific statutory procedures to reach its decisions about pension plans. Thus, under Vermont Yankee, the APA establishes the maximum procedural requirements a court can impose on the PBGC.

### Olivares v. Transportation Security Administration

Alberto Olivares (plaintiff), a Venezuelan national, applied to attend a Federal Aviation Administration flight school to become a certified pilot in the United States.

TSA conducted a background check - Olivares had been convicted of conspiracy with intent to distribute a controlled substance, had been accused of firearms trafficking in Aruba, and maintained a residence in the United States. Based on these factors, the TSA determined that Olivares presented a risk to aviation or national security and denied the application.

TSA sent Olivares an email stating that the application was denied because “TSA is unable to determine that you do not pose a threat to aviation or national security.” Olivares filed suit appealing the decision on the ground that the TSA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by not providing a statement of the grounds for denial.

The APA requires an agency denying an application to provide a brief statement of the grounds for denial. (1) This statement must provide the reasons for the denial and cannot simply be a regurgitation of the relevant statute; and (2) the reasons must be contemporaneous with the decision and cannot be post hoc rationalizations for the decision.

The email does not provide a statement of the grounds for denial but rather is a regurgitation of the relevant statute. However, the declaration and related materials satisfy the APA’s requirement of a brief statement of the grounds for denial.

The declaration filed in this proceeding fully explains the grounds for the denial and shows that the grounds were contemporaneous with the decision and not post hoc rationalizations. In the future, agencies will be well advised to obey the explicit command of 555(e)
