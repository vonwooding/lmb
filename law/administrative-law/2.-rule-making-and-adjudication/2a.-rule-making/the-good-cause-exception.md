# The Good Cause Exception

{% file src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/APA Good Cause Exception.pdf" %}

#### The "Good Cause" exemption to the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirement is often invoked in the following scenarios:

1. When advance notice of rulemaking will defeat the regulatory objective
2. When immediate action is necessary to reduce or avoid health hazards or imminent harm to persons or property
3. When immediate action is required to prevent serious dislocation in the marketplace
4. When a delay in promulgation will cause an injurious inconsistency between an agency rule and a newly enacted statute or judicial decision
