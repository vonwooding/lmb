# Administrative Law

Administrative agencies have no independent existence. They are created, enabled, and empowered by the legislatiure and to a lesser extent by the executive.&#x20;

Congress creates skeletal acts and then passes the statute to the agency to determine the technical components and how it will be implemented. The agency is more familiar in these areas and so Congress needs admin agency input.&#x20;

For that reason, we must always look for an admin agency's **source of authority.**
