Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.&#x20;

> In these consolidated cases, we decide whether the Government created lawful exemptions from a **regulatory requirement** implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA).
>
>
>
> The requirement obligates certain employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees through their group health plans. Though contraceptive coverage is not required by (or even mentioned in) the ACA provision at issue, the Government mandated such coverage by promulgating **interim final rules (IFRs)** shortly after the ACA's passage. This requirement is known as the contraceptive mandate.
>
>
>
> After six years of protracted litigation, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (together Departments)—which jointly administer the relevant ACA provision—exempted certain employers who have religious and conscientious objections from this **agency-created mandate**. The Third Circuit concluded that the Departments lacked statutory authority to promulgate these exemptions and affirmed the District Court's nationwide preliminary injunction.&#x20;
>
>
>
> That decision was erroneous. **We hold that the Departments had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections.** We accordingly reverse the Third Circuit's judgment and remand with instructions to dissolve the nationwide preliminary injunction.

### Supporting Materials

Supreme Court United States opinion syllabus in **Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania** certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit argued May 6 2012.

ACA requires covered employers to provide women with preventive care and screenings without any cost-sharing requirements and relies on preventative care guidelines supported by the health resources and Services Administration HRSA to determine what preventive care and screenings includes.

48 USC Section 313 a for those guidelines mandate that health plans provide coverage for all food and drug administration approved contraceptive methods when the department of Health and Human Services labor and the Treasury incorporated the guidelines.

They also gave HRSA the discretion to exempt religious employers such as churches from providing contraceptive coverage.

Later, the departments also promulgated rule accommodating qualifying religious organizations that allowed them to opt-out of coverage by self-certifying that they meet certain criteria to their health insurance issuer, which would then exclude contraceptive coverage from the employers plan and provide participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements.

Religious entities challenged the rules under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993 as referenced in **Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores.**&#x20;

This Court held that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened the free exercise of closely held corporations as with sincerely held religious beliefs objections to providing their employees with certain methods of contraception.&#x20;

And in **Subic versus Burwell,** this Court opted to remain remand without deciding the referent question in cases challenging the vacation accommodation so that the parties could develop an approach that would accommodate employers as concerns while providing women full and equal coverage in light of **Hobby Lobby's** holding.

Two rules

The first significantly expanded the church's exemption to include an employer that objects based on its sincerely held religious beliefs to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering or arranging for coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services.

The second created a similar moral exemption for employers with sincerely held moral objections to providing some or all forms of contraceptive coverage.&#x20;

The department's requested post-promulgation comments on both IFRS Pennsylvania suit alleging that the IFRS were procedurally and substantively invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act after the department issued final rules responding to post promulgation comments but leaving the IFRS largely intact New Jersey joined Pennsylvania's suit together they filed an amended complaint alleging that the rules were substantive ly unlawful because the department's lacked statutory authority under either the ACA or rifra to promulgate the exemptions they also argued that the rules were procedurally defective because the department's failed to comply with the AP A's notice and comment procedures the district court issued a preliminary nationwide injunction against the implementation of the final rules in the Third Circuit affirmed the Supreme Court held the decision below is reversed and remanded and Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the court the department's the department's had the authority under the ACA to promulgate the religious and moral exemptions as legal authority for both exemptions the department's invoke section 300 G G 13 a 4 which states that group health plans must provide women with preventive care and screenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the HRSA the pivotal phrase as provided for grants sweeping authority to HRSA to define the preventive care that applicable health plans must cover that same grant of authority empowers it to identify and create exemptions from its own guidelines the fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that absent provisions cannot be supplied by the courts that's rot ski versus clem applies not only to adding terms not found in the statute but also to imposing limits on an agency's discretion that are not supported by the text C Wyatt versus Energy Action Edie foundation concerns that the exemptions thought Congress is intent by making it sufficiently harder for interested women to abstain obtained seamless access to contraception without cost-sharing cannot justify justify supplanting the text plain meaning even if such concerns are legitimate they are more properly directed at the regulatory mechanism that Congress put in place because the ACA provided for a basis for both exemptions the court need not decide whether rifra independently compelled the department's solution however the argument that the department's could not consider rifra at all is without merit it is clear from the face of the statute that the contraceptive mandate is capable of violating rifra the ACA does not explicitly exempt rifra in the regulations implementing the contraceptive mandate qualify as federal law or the implementation of federal law under rifra that's section 2000 b b - 3a additionally this Court stated in Hobby Lobby that the mandate violated rifra as applied to entities with complicity based objections and both Hobby Lobby and zubik instructed the departments to consider riff-raff going forward moreover in light of the basic requirements of the rulemaking process the department's failure to discuss rifra at all when formulating their solution would make them susceptible to claims that the rules were arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider an important aspect of the problem the rules promulgating the exemptions are free from procedural defects respondents claim that because the final rules were preceded by a document entitled interim final rules with requests for comments instead of general notice of proposed rulemaking they are procedurally invalid under the APA the IFRS request for comments readily satisfy the APA notice requirements in even assuming that the APA requires an agency to publish a document entitled notice of proposed rulemaking there was no procedural error here that's a 5 USC sections 76 there section 7 0 6 pointing to the fact that the final rules made only minor alterations to the IFRS respondents also contend that the final rules are procedurally invalid because nothing in the record suggests that the department's maintained an open mind during the post promulgation process the open mindedness test has no basis in the APA each of the APA is procedural requirements was satisfied the IFRS provided sufficient notice section 5 v 3 B the department's gave interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data or views or arguments section 5 v 3 C the final rules contained a concise general statement of their basis and purpose and they were published more than 30 days before they became effective section 5 v 5 section 5 v 3d the decision below is reversed and remanded justice thomas delivered the opinion in the court in which Chief Justice Roberts and justices Alito Gorsuch and Cavanaugh joined Justice Alito filed a concurring opinion in which justice Gorsuch joined Justice Kagan filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which justices are Justice Breyer join Justice Ginsburg filed scenting opinion in which justice sotomayor are joined
