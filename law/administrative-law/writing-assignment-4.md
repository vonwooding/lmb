## Syllabus

**The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)** requires covered employers to provide women with “preventive care and screenings” without “any cost-sharing requirements.”

The ACA relies on **Preventive Care Guidelines (Guidelines)** “supported by the **Health Resources and Services Administration” (HRSA)** to determine what “preventive care and screenings” includes. [42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-13#a\_4).&#x20;

#### Those Guidelines mandate that health plans provide coverage for all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods.&#x20;

1. When the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (Departments) incorporated the Guidelines, they also gave HRSA the discretion to exempt religious employers, such as churches, from providing contraceptive coverage.&#x20;
2. Later, the Departments also promulgated a rule accommodating qualifying religious organizations that allowed them to opt-out of coverage by self-certifying that they met certain criteria to their health insurance issuer, which would then exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan and provide participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements.

#### Religious entities challenged the rules under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA).

1. In _**Burwell**_** v. **_**Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.**_**,** [573 U. S. 682](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/682), this Court held that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened the free exercise of closely held corporations with sincerely held religious objections to providing their employees with certain methods of contraception.
2. And in _**Zubik**_** v. **_**Burwell**_, the Court opted to remand without deciding the RFRA question in cases challenging the self-certification accommodation so that the parties could develop an approach that would accommodate employers’ concerns while providing women full and equal coverage.

#### Under _Zubik_’s direction and in light of _Hobby Lobby_’s holding, the Departments promulgated two interim final rules (IFRs).&#x20;

1. The first significantly expanded the church exemption to include an employer that **“objects based on its sincerely held religious beliefs,”** “to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging \[for] coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services.**”**  [82 Fed. Reg. 47812](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rio/citation/82\_FR\_47812).&#x20;
2. The second created a similar **“moral exemption”** for employers with sincerely held moral objections to providing some or all forms of contraceptive coverage.&#x20;

The Departments requested post-promulgation comments on both IFRs.

Pennsylvania sued, alleging that the IFRs were procedurally and substantively invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After the Departments issued final rules, responding to post-promulgation comments but leaving the IFRs largely intact, New Jersey joined Pennsylvania’s suit. Together they filed an amended complaint, alleging that the rules were substantively unlawful because the Departments lacked statutory authority under either the ACA or RFRA to promulgate the exemptions. They also argued that the rules were procedurally defective because the Departments failed to comply with the APA’s notice and comment procedures. The District Court issued a preliminary nationwide injunction against the implementation of the final rules, and the Third Circuit affirmed.&#x20;

### _Holding_

#### 1. The Departments had the authority under the ACA to promulgate the religious and moral exemptions. Pp. 14–22.

   (a) As legal authority for both exemptions, the Departments invoke §300gg–13(a)(4), which states that group health plans must provide women with “preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by \[HRSA].” The pivotal phrase, “as provided for,” grants sweeping authority to HRSA to define the preventive care that applicable health plans must cover. That same grant of authority empowers it to identify and create exemptions from its own Guidelines. The “fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that ‘absent provision\[s] cannot be supplied by the courts,’ ” _**Rotkiske**_** v. **_**Klemm**_, applies not only to adding terms not found in the statute, but also to imposing limits on an agency’s discretion that are not supported by the text, see _**Watt**_** v. **_**Energy Action Ed. Foundation**_, [454 U. S. 151](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/454/151), 168. Concerns that the exemptions thwart Congress’ intent by making it significantly harder for interested women to obtain seamless access to contraception without cost-sharing cannot justify supplanting the text’s plain meaning. Even if such concerns are legitimate, they are more properly directed at the regulatory mechanism that Congress put in place.

   (b) Because the ACA provided a basis for both exemptions, the Court need not decide whether RFRA independently compelled the Departments’ solution. However, the argument that the Departments could not consider RFRA at all is without merit. It is clear from the face of the statute that the contraceptive mandate is capable of violating RFRA. The ACA does not explicitly exempt RFRA, and the regulations implementing the contraceptive mandate qualify as “Federal law” or “the implementation of \[Federal] law” under RFRA. §2000bb–3(a). Additionally, this Court stated in _Hobby_ _Lobby_ that the mandate violated RFRA as applied to entities with complicity-based objections. And both _Hobby_ _Lobby_ and _Zubik_ instructed the Departments to consider RFRA going forward. Moreover, in light of the basic requirements of the rulemaking process, the Departments’ failure to discuss RFRA at all when formulating their solution would make them susceptible to claims that the rules were arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider an important aspect of the problem. Pp. 19–22.

#### **2. The rules promulgating the exemptions are free from procedural defects. Pp. 22–26.**

   (a) Respondents claim that because the final rules were preceded by a document entitled “Interim Final Rules with Request for Comments” instead of “General Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” they are procedurally invalid under the APA. The IFRs’ request for comments readily satisfied the APA notice requirements. And even assuming that the APA requires an agency to publish a document entitled “notice of proposed rulemaking,” there was no “prejudicial error” here, [5 U. S. C. §706](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706). Pp. 22–24.

   (b) Pointing to the fact that the final rules made only minor alterations to the IFRs, respondents also contend that the final rules are procedurally invalid because nothing in the record suggests that the Departments maintained an open mind during the post-promulgation process. The “open-mindedness” test has no basis in the APA. Each of the APA’s procedural requirements was satisfied: The IFRs provided sufficient notice, §553(b); the Departments “g\[a]ve interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule-making through submission of written data, views or arguments,” §553(c); the final rules contained “a concise general statement of their basis and purpose,” _ibid._; and they were published more than 30 days before they became effective, §553(d). Pp. 24–26.[930 F. 3d 543](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rio/citation/930\_F.3d\_543), reversed and remanded.

### Opinion

Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., joined. Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch, J., joined.  Kagan, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Breyer, J., joined. Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Sotomayor, J., joined.

> In these consolidated cases, we decide whether the Government created lawful exemptions from a **regulatory requirement** implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA).
>
>
>
> The requirement obligates certain employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees through their group health plans. Though contraceptive coverage is not required by (or even mentioned in) the ACA provision at issue, the Government mandated such coverage by promulgating **interim final rules (IFRs)** shortly after the ACA's passage. This requirement is known as the contraceptive mandate.
>
>
>
> After six years of protracted litigation, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (together Departments)—which jointly administer the relevant ACA provision—exempted certain employers who have religious and conscientious objections from this **agency-created mandate**. The Third Circuit concluded that the Departments lacked statutory authority to promulgate these exemptions and affirmed the District Court's nationwide preliminary injunction.&#x20;
>
>
>
> That decision was erroneous. **We hold that the Departments had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections.** We accordingly reverse the Third Circuit's judgment and remand with instructions to dissolve the nationwide preliminary injunction.
