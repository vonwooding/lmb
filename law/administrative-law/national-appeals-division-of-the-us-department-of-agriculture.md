# National Appeals Division of the US Department of Agriculture

## What is NAD?

This is a [glossary ](https://www.usda.gov/glossary)defining words commonly used by the USDA. The NAD was established by the [Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994](https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/3171). That Act "Directs the Secretary to establish in the Department an independent National Appeals Division.&#x20;

Transfers to the Division all functions and pending appeals relating to: (1) the National Appeals Division established by the Agricultural Act of 1949; (2) the National Appeals Division established by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act; (3) Federal Crop Insurance Corporation appeals; and (4) Soil Conservation Service appeals."

Since NAD is likely an Article I tribunal, then it  may follow the rule from [Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray's\_Lessee\_v.\_Hoboken\_Land\_%26\_Improvement\_Co.), where the Supreme Court ruled that legal matters involving public rights are inherently judicial, and thus are susceptible to review by an Article III court.

This is an explainer video of how and where you can file an appeal of a program decision by USDA agencies that does not go in your favor to receive an impartial hearing within 45 days. ([Youtube 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zJtJnOpY58)) This video explains how the NAD is an adjudicatory office that reports directly to the Secretary of Agriculture and is, by law, independent from the direction and control of any other agency within USDA. It is part of the USDA's office of Hearing and Appeals ([Youtube 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGeZRHJBtrg))
