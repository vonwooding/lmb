# Rule 803: Hearsay Exception Regardless of Whether the Declarant Is Available



The following statements are **not excluded** by the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness.

## 803(1) Present Sense Impression

### State v. Phillips

> “My husband is having an affair and I am going to divorce him.”

This was not something she was observing as it was happening. A present sense impression must be what you are immediately perceiving and not the preliminary conclusions you are drawing at the present time.&#x20;

#### Three requirements:

1. the statement must happen at the time of the event
2. the statement must describe the event; and
3. the event must be something within the declarant’s personal knowledge

### U.S. v. Murillo

> “I’m with Diana and Rico.”

This is a contemporaneous description of what the victim was experiencing or seeing and thus satisfies the rule.&#x20;

### U.S. v. Delaphane

\[insert]

### Hallums v. United States

\[insert]

## 803(2) Excited Utterance

### State v. Sutphin

How long until an excited utterance becomes inadmissible? 5 factor test:

1. the length of time between the event and statement
2. age of declarant
3. physical and mental state of declarant
4. characteristic of the event
5. subject matter of the statement

### State v. Jeffers

## 803(3) Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition

### State v. Phillips

The defendant shot his wife with a shotgun. He claimed it was an accident. The prosecution introduced evidence of an extra-material affair to show motive to kill.

Under Rule 803(3), hearsay is admissible if it is a statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health). Statements admissible under Rule 803(3) must relate to the state of mind existing at the time of the communication.

**This exception encompasses the following four kinds of extrajudicial statements:**

1. \*\*Statements of present bodily condition; \*\*
2. \*\*Statements of present state of mind or emotion, offered to prove a state of mind or emotion of the declarant that is \`in issue' in the case; \*\*
3. \*\*Statements of present state of mind—usually intent, plan, or design—offered to prove subsequent conduct of the declarant in accordance with the state of mind; and \*\*
4. \*\*Statements of a testator indicating his state of mind offered on certain issues in a will case \*\*

Although the declarant's state of mind does not have to be directly in issue for the statement to be admissible under Rule 803(3), where a statement is introduced to show the declarant subsequently acted in compliance with this state of mind, the state of mind must be relevant.

### State v. Frost

Defendant Frost killed the victim, Regina Slonim, by stabbing her 29 times. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing State witness Karenca Price, the front desk clerk, to testify that he told her of his desire to have the victim fired. Price explained that defendant and the victim had argued and that he told her “he would get Regina fired by saying that she was using cocaine.”

The statement was admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, which governs statements of the declarant's “then existing state of mind, emotions, sensations, or physical condition offered to prove the declarant's future action.”

The statement was relevant to the issue of specific intent and further supported the State's theory that defendant carefully planned the murder, choosing the clerk he liked the least to rob as he knew he would have to kill her to have any chance of avoiding apprehension by police.

### Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hilmon

The rule applicable to this case has been thus stated by this court: "Wherever the bodily or mental feelings of an individual are material to be proved, the usual expressions of such feelings are original and competent evidence. Those expressions are the natural reflexes of what it might be impossible to show by other testimony. If there be such other testimony, this may be necessary to set the facts thus developed in their true light, and to give them their proper effect.

As independent explanatory or corroborative evidence, it is often indispensable to the due administration of justice. Such declarations are regarded as verbal acts, and are as competent as any other testimony, when relevant to the issue. Their truth or falsity is an inquiry for the jury." [Insurance Co. v. Mosley, 8 Wall.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=12914585457779444937\&hl=en\&q=145+us+285)

### Shepard v. United States

Charles A. Shepard, a major in the medical corps of the United States army, has been convicted of the murder of his wife, Zenana Shepard, at Fort Riley, Kansas, a United States military reservation.

The government wanted to introduce evidence of a conversation between Zenana and nurse Clara Brown.

Zenana asked the nurse to go to the closet in the defendant's room and bring a bottle of whisky that would be found upon a shelf. When the bottle was produced, she said that this was the liquor she had taken just before collapsing. She asked whether enough was left to make a test for the presence of poison, insisting that the smell and taste were strange. And then she added the words "Dr. Shepard has poisoned me."

### United States v. Houlihan

James Boyden Jr. was found dead; he had been shot in the back of the head. At issue in this case is whether Boyden's statement to his sister -- that he was going "to meet Billy Herd," one of the co-defendants in this case -- is admissible as evidence that he actually met Billy Herd.

This case presents an issue of first impression in the First Circuit: Whether the out-of-court statement of a victim-declarant of an intention to meet with a defendant on the evening of the victim's murder can be admitted at trial as circumstantial evidence of the meeting.

The court observed a circuit split on this question, observing that the Second and Fourth Circuits permit statements made about activity with third parties only if there's corroborating evidence that the third parties acted consistent with the statement. The Ninth Circuit, by contrast, required no such corroboration to admit statements involving the the activity of third parties under Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).

James Boyden Jr.'s statement that he was going out "to meet Billy Herd" is admissible against Herd under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3)

## Exceptions 1-8

### Absence of Regularly Recorded Activity

(7) **Absence of a Record of a Regularly Conducted Activity**. Evidence that a matter is not included in a record described in paragraph (6) if: (A) the evidence is admitted to prove that the matter did not occur or exist; (B) a record was regularly kept for a matter of that kind; and (C) the opponent does not show that the possible source of the information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

(case: Wallace v. Target Stores)

Here, a witness who was an officer of the company at issue testified that the correspondence, memoranda, and computer printouts were produced in the course of the business as a means of keeping track in detail of transactions because of the large volume of merchandise that was sold. He further stated that they were produced by persons who necessarily had knowledge of, or had obtained the information from persons who had knowledge of, the activities recorded. This foundation testimony is buttressed by the need of a business to impose on the employees the duty to report accurately on a regular basis information about the business activity. \_See \_[_Great West Packers, Inc. v. Longmont Food Co.,_ 636 P.2d 1331 (Colo.App.1981)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=18316104814420064309\&hl=en\&q=701+P.2d+1272).

Because the trial court found that these records were kept in the regular course of business, as a regular practice of that business, and because there was neither evidence nor a finding of untrustworthiness, the admission of the evidence was not error.

Any incompleteness of the business entries, the business records, or the summaries or compilations thereof, goes to the weight of the evidence, and not to its admissibility. \_See \_[_United States v. Baxter,_ 492 F.2d 150 (9th Cir.1973)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=2819261199098020865\&hl=en\&q=701+P.2d+1272).

### Public Records

(8) **Public Records**. A record or statement of a public office if: (A) it sets out: (i) the office’s activities; (ii) a matter observed while under a legal duty to report, but not including, in a criminal case, a matter observed by law-enforcement personnel; or (iii) in a civil case or against the government in a criminal case, factual findings from a legally authorized investigation; and (B) the opponent does not show that the source of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

(case: Worster v. Watkins)

For a police report to qualify as a business record, the author of the report must "be acting in the regular course of business, and if the information was supplied by another, that person also \[must] be acting in the regular course of business." 2 MCCORMICK, _supra_ § 290, at 273. Only when everyone involved in preparing a report is acting in the regular course of business can we conclude that the report is accurate and therefore worthy of being admitted. 2 MCCORMICK, _supra_ at 274.

When these principles are applied to this case, Detective Curtis' report must be excluded. While Detective Curtis was acting in the regular course of business when he completed his supplementary investigation report, the same cannot be said for Fowlie. He was under no obligation to talk to the police and, as a result, "an essential link in the trustworthiness chain fails ...." 2 MCCORMICK, _supra_ at 274. Therefore, his statements cannot qualify under Rule 803(6). \_See \_[_United States v. Snyder,_ 787 F.2d 1429, 1434 (10th Cir.),](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=7134622534638243068\&hl=en\&q=669+A.2d+212) _cert. denied,_ [479 U.S. 836 (1986)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?about=17182947360944332898\&as\_sdt=6%2C39\&hl=en\&q=669+A.2d+212).

## Exception 9-16

### Public Records of Vital Statistics

(case: Bernstein v. Rosenthal)

At the time of Gwendolyn's death she held a life insurance policy in the amount of $49,000 wherein Ronald was the named beneficiary. Appellee, the personal representative of Gwendolyn's estate, filed suit claiming that Ronald's estate was not entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance policy because Ronald was guilty of Gwendolyn's murder. Ronald's estate claimed the proceeds by reason of Ronald's survival of Gwendolyn.

The court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Ronald was guilty of second degree murder and that, as a result, his estate was not entitled to receive the proceeds of Gwendolyn's life insurance policy. Appellant . . . cites the admission of the coroner's reports and death certificates as error. We disagree with this contention.

CRE 803(8) and (9) specifically allow for the introduction of public records and reports and records of vital statistics. The coroner's reports qualify as public records, and the death certificates are records of vital statistics. Thus, their introduction was proper.

### Absence of Public Record

(10) **Absence of a Public Record**. Testimony — or a certification under [Rule 902](https://rulesofevidence.org/article-ix/rule-902/) — that a diligent search failed to disclose a public record or statement if: (A) the testimony or certification is admitted to prove that (i) the record or statement does not exist; or (ii) a matter did not occur or exist, if a public office regularly kept a record or statement for a matter of that kind; and (B) in a criminal case, a prosecutor who intends to offer a certification provides written notice of that intent at least 14 days before trial, and the defendant does not object in writing within 7 days of receiving the notice — unless the court sets a different time for the notice or the objection.

(case: State v. Wheel)

Defendant was a Chittenden County assistant judge from 1975 to 1987. On November 14, 1985, the attorney general began an investigation into whether defendant had improperly submitted false pay vouchers for days on which she did not work.

The attorney general began an investigation into whether defendant had improperly submitted false pay vouchers for days on which she did not work. The State concluded that defendant may have altered the case files in order to make it appear that she had attended court proceedings when in fact she had not.

As a result of statements she made at the May 6 inquest, she was charged with several counts of false swearing.

Defendant contends that the court erred by allowing the State's investigator to offer hearsay testimony (1) summarizing the court documents he reviewed during his investigations into whether defendant attended court proceedings, and (2) stating what he had learned from other assistant judges regarding the duties that entitle assistant judges to claim state pay.

We disagree.

V.R.E. 803(10) (hearsay exception exists for evidence of the absence of a public record or an entry in a public record that would normally have been recorded had the event taken place). Prior testimony established that the requirements of V.R.E. 803(10) had been met: a record of the attendance of judges was regularly kept by a public office, and a diligent search failed to disclose the pertinent entries.

### Record of Religious Organizations Concerning Family History

(case: Keate v. State)

Appellant Allan Eugene Keate and nine other members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), living at the YFZ (Yearning for Zion) Ranch in Schleicher County, Texas, were indicted for sexual assault of a child.

Appellant argues that the trial judge erred in admitting documentary evidence seized from the vaults of the temple and temple annex of the YFZ Ranch. Appellant characterizes FLDS as an extreme breakaway sect of the Mormon church and appears to argue that because the church and the views of its leader (the prophet) are not mainstream, these documents should not be included in the hearsay exception for religious organizations.

Texas Rule of Evidence 803(11) excludes from the hearsay rule "\[s]tatements of births, marriages, divorces, deaths, legitimacy, ancestry, relationship by blood or marriage, or other similar facts of personal or family history, contained in a regularly kept record of a religious organization." Similarly, Texas Rule of Evidence 803(13) excludes "\[s]tatements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in family Bibles, genealogies, charts, engravings on rings, inscriptions on family portraits, engravings on urns, crypts, or tombstones, or the like."

Here, the documents about which appellant complains were various documents relating to marriages, births, family relationships, personal history, and family history of FLDS members.

### Certificate of Marriage, etc.

(case: Matueszewsk v. Pancoast)

Appellants contend the trial court erred in accepting several baptismal certificates and one marriage certificate for the purpose of determining appellants' father . . . was one of five siblings which included the deceased's mother . . . It is undisputed the baptismal certificates and marriage certificate are private records from a church in Poland

Marriage, baptismal, and similar certificates. Statements of fact contained in a certificate that the maker performed a marriage or other ceremony or administered a sacrament, made by a clergyman, public official, or other person authorized by the rules or practices of a religious organization or by law to perform the act certified, and purporting to have been issued at the time of the act or within a reasonable time thereafter. These are not excluded as hearsay.

The rule, therefore, permits the certificates to be introduced into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted, _viz.,_ the existence of a marriage . . . and the children born of that union . . .

### Family Records

(case: In re Egbert’s Estate)

Plaintiff first contends that the probate court erred in denying her request to admit into evidence two proposed exhibits to prove her relationship to decedent.

The first proposed exhibit, a memorial card, was voluntarily withdrawn by plaintiff's counsel and, therefore, the question of its admissibility is not properly before this Court. The second proposed exhibit was a picture postcard. On the front of the postcard is a photograph of a young girl, who plaintiff alleges is herself. On the back is the alleged handwriting of the deceased stating: "Ren Robinson, My Sister, Daughter, Age About 3, _/s/ Ernest Egbert"._

The photo is admissible under "(4) Statement of personal or family history. (A) A statement concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared."

The photograph could also be admissible under MRE 803(16) as an ancient document in existence 20 years or more, or under MRE 803(13), which provides that the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule: "(13) Family records. Statements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in family Bibles, genealogies, charts, engravings on rings, _inscriptions on family portraits,_ engravings on urns, crypts, or tombstones, or the like."

### Records of Documents that Affect an Interest in Property

(case: Compton v. Davis Oil)

This case involved the question of whether Nettie Schofield was married to Dave Lewis at the time of his death in 1935. Two land transfers were offered to support the contention that they were

On September 26, 1929 "Dave Lewis & (Mrs. Nettie Lewis) his wife, grantor" executed a "Warranty Deed with Release of Homestead" conveying property in Campbell County, Wyoming not directly in issue in this proceeding to L.F. Heydecker, grantee.

Then, on August 11, 1930, "Dave Lewis and Nettie Lewis, husband and wife, grantors" executed a Warranty Deed and Release of Homestead conveying the relevant property to T.L. Platt, grantee, releasing and waiving "all rights under and by virtue of homestead exemption laws of the State of Wyoming" and reserving "all oil, minerals and gas in the above lands" in grantor.

Direct, reliable evidence . . . establishes that Dave and Nettie Lewis were married, and were husband and wife until Dave's death in 1935. That evidence consisted of the recitals in the two warranty deeds executed by Dave and Nettie as husband and wife, and the statements made by Lonnie Lewis contained in Dave Lewis' death certificate concerning Dave's marital status. Recitals contained . . . in documents and records affecting interests in property are admissible as proof of the matters asserted, and constitute strong evidence concerning such matters. _Fed.R.Evid._ 803(14), (15).

The rule states that subsequent dealings inconsistent with the truth of the statements or purport of the document undermine the presumption of reliability. _Id. Fed.R.Evid._ 803(15). Here the Lewis heirs, with full knowledge of the existence of the mineral estate, acted as if title to the property was in Nettie Lewis and her heirs between 1935 and 1972, a period of 37 years. They failed to assert any objection to her exercise of dominion over the property, and they did not attempt to exercise any dominion over the property on their own behalf until over a decade after Nettie's death.

### Statements in Documents That Affect an Interest in Property

(People v. Burton)

Defendant Johnnie Burton, Jr., is charged with second-degree murder possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and mutilation of a body defendant filed a motion in limine to suppress introduction of an unsigned, undated, handwritten statement by his wife, Jearleane Burton The writing implicated defendant in the October 15, 1987, homicide of William O. Ross. the Detroit Recorder's Court ruled the evidence admissible the prosecutor argued that the purported will was admissible under MRE 803(15) as an exception to the hearsay rule. Defendant argued that MRE 803(15) was inapplicable because disposition of property was not at issue and because the writing was not a valid holographic will as it was not dated or signed. At issue is a less than 2 1/4-page handwritten statement on 8 1/2 X 11 inch paper, allegedly prepared by defendant's wife, Jearleane Burton. a two-page narrative explaining that Burton was in fear for her life and detailing the events surrounding the killing and mutilation of the victim by defendant. The writing concludes, "Anything I own that would \[sic] please go to my mother and family." Mrs. Burton's statement must be sufficiently related to a disposition of property to guarantee its trustworthiness under the exception. In this case, we find it is not. whether or not the writing purports to establish or affect an interest in property, the lengthy description of the crime is not a matter germane to the purpose of the document. First, the only elements of the writing that are testamentary in nature are the first and last sentences of the 2 1/4-page documen not testamentary but more akin to a journal entry or confession no specific disposition of property is mentioned Additionally, the manner of execution of the writing detracts from its trustworthiness. The "purported" will is not dated, signed or witnessed.

We therefore find the writing to be an unreliable, untested out-of-court assertion. As such, its introduction into defendant's criminal proceeding to establish the truth of the matters asserted is directly offensive to the hearsay rule.

## Confrontation Clause

#### The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause is an additional barrier to entry for evidence offered against a defendant in a criminal case.

This requirement used to be based on the notion of relevance but Scalia articulated that it is also about protecting the procedural rights of a criminal defendant.

The principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the use of _ex parte_ examinations as evidence against the accused. It was these practices that the Crown deployed in notorious treason cases.

### Crawford v. Washington

Defendant Crawford stabbed Kenneth Lee who allegedly tried to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia did not testify because of the state marital privilege. At trial, the state introduced Sylvia's prior tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing. Crawford had no opportunity for cross exmaination.

The question presented is whether this procedure complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him."

#### \*\*Witness Statement v. Testimonial \*\*

The confrontation clause applies to witnesses against the accused (bearers of testimony). Testimony on the other hand is a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.

There is little evidence that hearsay exceptions were invoked to admit _testimonial_ statements against the accused in a _criminal_ case. Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial — for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.

### Davis v. Washington

When are statements made to law enforcement personnel during a 911 call or at a crime scene "testimonial" and thus subject to the requirements of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause?

Michelle McCottry informed a 911 operator that she was involved in a domestic disturbance with her former boyfriend Adrian Davis. The State charged Davis with felony violation of a domestic no-contact order. The State's only witnesses were the two police officers who responded to the 911 call.

The court cited Hammon v. Indiana in which Mrs. Hammond informed a police officer that Mr. Hammon had pushed her onto the ground, had shoved her head into the broken glass of the heater and that he had punched her in the chest twice. Mr. Hammond was convicted.

The Court also cited Crawford - "even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class."

The difference between the interrogation in _Davis_ and the one in _Crawford_ is apparent. In _Davis,_ McCottry was speaking about events _as they were actually happening,_ rather than "describ\[ing] past events,"

The Court therefore found the statements in _Davis_ not to offend the Sixth Amendment as they were not testimonial, but found the Confrontation Clause to require the exclusion of the statements in _Hammon_ as these were testimonial.

### Giles v. California

Whether a defendant forfeits his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him when a judge determines that a wrongful act by the defendant made the witness unavailable to testify at trial. The Amendment contemplates that a witness who makes testimonial statements admitted against a defendant will ordinarily be present at trial for cross-examination, and that if the witness is unavailable, his prior testimony will be introduced only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.

Petitioner Dwayne Giles shot his ex-girlfriend, Brenda Avie, outside the garage of his grandmother's house

No witness saw the shooting Giles' niece heard what transpired from inside the house

Prosecutors sought to introduce statements that Avie had made to a police officer told the officer that Giles had accused her of having an affair, and that after the two began to argue, Giles grabbed her by the shirt, lifted her off the floor, and began to choke her

Giles punched her in the face and head, and after she broke free again, he opened a folding knife, held it about three feet away from her, and threatened to kill her if he found her cheating on him.

an exception to the confrontation guarantee permits the use of a witness's unconfronted testimony if a judge finds, as the judge did in this case, that the defendant committed a wrongful act that rendered the witness unavailable to testify at trial.

two forms of testimonial statements were admitted at common law even though they were unconfronted

1. declarations made by a speaker who was both on the brink of death and aware that he was dying forfeiture by wrongdoing
2. forfeiture by wrongdoing permits the introduction of statements of a witness who was "detained" or "kept away" by the "means or procurement" of the defendant. "engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness."

The requirement of intent "means that the exception applies only if the defendant has in mind the particular purpose of making the witness unavailable." The state courts in this case did not consider the intent of the defendant. This view of the law was error, but the court is free to consider evidence of the defendant's intent on remand.

### Michigan v. Bryant

At respondent Richard Bryant's trial, the court admitted statements that the victim, Anthony Covington, made to police officers who discovered him mortally wounded in a gas station parking lot.

When police responded, Covington was lying on the ground next to his car in a gas station parking lot with a severe gunshot wound to his abdomen. When prompted by police, Covington stated that "Rick" shot him at around 3 a.m. through the backdoor of his home and that Covington fled in his vehicle to the gas station.

Covington died. Police went to Rick Bryant's house and discovered blood and a gunshot hole in the backdoor - just as Covington had described shortly before passing away. They also found Covington's wallet in the back yard consistent with the fact that he had fled the scene in a panicked and rapid manner.

When police investigate an emergency scenario, their purpose is not prov\[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution but rather ending the particular threatening situation. Emergency scnerarios are sometimes ongoing, like here, when a defendant may be armed and dangerous and fleeing the pursuit of police. The logic is similar to the exception for an excited utterance - the declarant's motive for undue or improper fabrication is missing.

Covington's identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay.

Dissent (Scalia) - Almost 90 percent of murders involve a single victim, it is much more likely that the officers viewed their encounter with Covington for what it was: an investigation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.

### Bullcoming v. New Mexico

Donald Bullcoming was arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated. The state's principal evidence against Bullcoming was a forensic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming's blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI. But the state did not bring in the analyst who conducted and signed off on the test. they brought a different analyst to attest to the BAC test.

NM Supreme Court held that, although the BAC test analysis was testimonial, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the constitutional requirements even if that analyst had not signed off on the test results.

Whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification—made for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification.

Surrogate testimony of that order does not meet the constitutional requirement. The accused's right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.

New Mexico could have avoided any Confrontation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe. The prosecution faces this burden, not the defendent.

Dissent (Kennedy) - Requiring the State to call the technician who filled out a form and recorded the results of a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to challenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and examine the technician who performed a test. And it may call other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not always reliable or that the technician might have made a mistake.
