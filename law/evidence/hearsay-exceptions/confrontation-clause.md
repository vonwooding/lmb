# Confrontation Clause

o   Added requirement for the prosecution to show if it seeks to admit something that is an exception to hearsay against a defendant in a **criminal case**

§  In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him

§  Found in Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution

o   **Crawford Case**

§  The Confrontation Clause requires cross-examination whenever a statement that was made by a witness, who is now **not subject** to cross-examination, was made in anticipation of litigation

·      i.e., A statement that was prepared for the police or a prosecutor; a written or oral statement that was recorded

·      The statement **cannot be used unless the witness is there** to be cross-examined on it

§  In order to bring in a statement against a defendant in a criminal case:

·      **(1)** must show that there was a hearsay exception (federal or state rules)

·      **(2)** under Crawford, must show that the statement being brought in against the criminal defendant is not a statement that was made reasonably in anticipation of litigation

o   **Statement cannot be testimonial**

§  Testimonial = made in anticipation of litigation

o   Giles Case

§  If a witness was previously threatened about testifying and then does not come to trial out of fear of death, the prior threats are admitted under the hearsay exception and the Confrontation Clause

o   Bryant Case

§  Because the shooting had occurred only 25 minutes prior, and neither the police nor the victim knew where the shooter ran, the statement made identifying the shooter could be intended to help catch the shooter at that moment rather than to convict him later

·      Was the statement made to arrest him or convict him?

·      Was there an ongoing danger?

§  Dying declaration satisfies the Confrontation Clause

·      Davis Case

o   When you are calling to seek help or report a crime, which the Court describes as ongoing but has immediately passed, it is not for the purpose of offering testimony in a subsequent case, but used to resolve the current situation

o   Where the parties are separated and speak to the police separately, it is analogous to Crawford and the statements would be offered in anticipation of a criminal trial

o   Mens Rea matters: **why did you make this statement?**&#x20;
