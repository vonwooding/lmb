# Confrontation Clause

{% hint style="info" %}
The Confrontation Clause requires cross-examination whenever a statement that was made by a witness, who is now **not subject** to cross-examination, was made in anticipation of litigation**.**&#x20;



E.g., a statement that was prepared for the police or a prosecutor; a written or oral statement that was recorded.

## Confrontation Clause

#### The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause is an additional barrier to entry for evidence offered against a defendant in a criminal case.

This requirement used to be based on the notion of relevance but Scalia articulated that it is also about protecting the procedural rights of a criminal defendant.

The principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the use of _ex parte_ examinations as evidence against the accused. It was these practices that the Crown deployed in notorious treason cases.

### Crawford v. Washington

The statement **cannot be used unless the witness is there** to be cross-examined on it**.**  In order to bring in a statement against a defendant in a criminal case:&#x20;

1. must show that there was a hearsay exception (federal or state rules)&#x20;
2. under Crawford, must show that the statement being brought in against the criminal defendant is not a statement that was made reasonably in anticipation of litigation

The question presented is whether this procedure complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him."&#x20;

Defendant Crawford stabbed Kenneth Lee who allegedly tried to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia did not testify because of the state marital privilege. At trial, the state introduced Sylvia's prior tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing. Crawford had no opportunity for cross exmaination.

#### Witness Statement v. Testimonial

Testimonial = made in anticipation of litigation

The confrontation clause applies to witnesses against the accused (bearers of testimony). Testimony on the other hand is a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.

There is little evidence that hearsay exceptions were invoked to admit _testimonial_ statements against the accused in a _criminal_ case. Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial — for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.

### Davis v. Washington

{% hint style="info" %}
A dying declaration satisfies the Confrontation Clause.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

When are statements made to law enforcement personnel during a 911 call or at a crime scene "testimonial" and thus subject to the requirements of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause?

When you are calling to seek help or report a crime, which the Court describes as ongoing but has immediately passed, it is not for the purpose of offering testimony in a subsequent case, but used to resolve the current situation.

Michelle McCottry informed a 911 operator that she was involved in a domestic disturbance with her former boyfriend Adrian Davis. The State charged Davis with felony violation of a domestic no-contact order. The State's only witnesses were the two police officers who responded to the 911 call.

The court cited Hammon v. Indiana in which Mrs. Hammond informed a police officer that Mr. Hammon had pushed her onto the ground, had shoved her head into the broken glass of the heater and that he had punched her in the chest twice. Mr. Hammond was convicted. The Court also cited **Crawford** - "even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class."

The difference between the interrogation in _Davis_ and the one in _Crawford_ is apparent. In _Davis,_ McCottry was speaking about events _as they were actually happening,_ rather than "describ\[ing] past events,"

The Court found the statements in _Davis_ not to offend the Sixth Amendment as they were not testimonial but found the Confrontation Clause to require the exclusion of the statements in _Hammon_ as these were testimonial.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Where the parties are separated and speak to the police separately, it is analogous to Crawford and the statements would be offered in anticipation of a criminal trial. Mens Rea matters: **why did you make this statement?**&#x20;

### Giles v. California

{% hint style="info" %}
If a witness was previously threatened about testifying and then does not come to trial out of fear of death, the prior threats are admitted under the hearsay exception and the Confrontation Clause.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Whether a defendant forfeits his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him when a judge determines that a wrongful act by the defendant made the witness unavailable to testify at trial. The Amendment contemplates that a witness who makes testimonial statements admitted against a defendant will ordinarily be present at trial for cross-examination, and that if the witness is unavailable, his prior testimony will be introduced only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.

Petitioner Dwayne Giles shot his ex-girlfriend, Brenda Avie, outside the garage of his grandmother's house

No witness saw the shooting Giles' niece heard what transpired from inside the house

Prosecutors sought to introduce statements that Avie had made to a police officer told the officer that Giles had accused her of having an affair, and that after the two began to argue, Giles grabbed her by the shirt, lifted her off the floor, and began to choke her

Giles punched her in the face and head, and after she broke free again, he opened a folding knife, held it about three feet away from her, and threatened to kill her if he found her cheating on him.

an exception to the confrontation guarantee permits the use of a witness's unconfronted testimony if a judge finds, as the judge did in this case, that the defendant committed a wrongful act that rendered the witness unavailable to testify at trial.

two forms of testimonial statements were admitted at common law even though they were unconfronted

1. declarations made by a speaker who was both on the brink of death and aware that he was dying forfeiture by wrongdoing
2. forfeiture by wrongdoing permits the introduction of statements of a witness who was "detained" or "kept away" by the "means or procurement" of the defendant. "engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness."

The requirement of intent "means that the exception applies only if the defendant has in mind the particular purpose of making the witness unavailable." The state courts in this case did not consider the intent of the defendant. This view of the law was error, but the court is free to consider evidence of the defendant's intent on remand.

### Michigan v. Bryant

At respondent Richard Bryant's trial, the court admitted statements that the victim, Anthony Covington, made to police officers who discovered him mortally wounded in a gas station parking lot.

When police responded, Covington was lying on the ground next to his car in a gas station parking lot with a severe gunshot wound to his abdomen. When prompted by police, Covington stated that "Rick" shot him at around 3 a.m. through the backdoor of his home and that Covington fled in his vehicle to the gas station.

Covington died. Police went to Rick Bryant's house and discovered blood and a gunshot hole in the backdoor - just as Covington had described shortly before passing away. They also found Covington's wallet in the back yard consistent with the fact that he had fled the scene in a panicked and rapid manner.

When police investigate an emergency scenario, their purpose is not prov\[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution but rather ending the particular threatening situation. Emergency scnerarios are sometimes ongoing, like here, when a defendant may be armed and dangerous and fleeing the pursuit of police. The logic is similar to the exception for an excited utterance - the declarant's motive for undue or improper fabrication is missing.

Covington's identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay.

Dissent (Scalia) - Almost 90 percent of murders involve a single victim, it is much more likely that the officers viewed their encounter with Covington for what it was: an investigation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.

### Bullcoming v. New Mexico

Donald Bullcoming was arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated. The state's principal evidence against Bullcoming was a forensic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming's blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI. But the state did not bring in the analyst who conducted and signed off on the test. they brought a different analyst to attest to the BAC test.

NM Supreme Court held that, although the BAC test analysis was testimonial, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the constitutional requirements even if that analyst had not signed off on the test results.

Whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification—made for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification.

Surrogate testimony of that order does not meet the constitutional requirement. The accused's right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.

New Mexico could have avoided any Confrontation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe. The prosecution faces this burden, not the defendent.

Dissent (Kennedy) - Requiring the State to call the technician who filled out a form and recorded the results of a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to challenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and examine the technician who performed a test. And it may call other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not always reliable or that the technician might have made a mistake.
