# Authenticating Evidence

## Rule 901 – Authenticating or Identifying Evidence

(a) To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.

1. **Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge.** Testimony that an item is what it is claimed to be.
2. **Nonexpert Opinion About Handwriting.** A nonexpert’s opinion that handwriting is genuine, based on a familiarity with it that was not acquired for the current litigation.
3. **Comparison by an Expert Witness or the Trier of Fact.** A comparison with an authenticated specimen by an expert witness or the trier of fact.
4. **Distinctive Characteristics and the Like.** The appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances.
5. **Opinion About a Voice.** An opinion identifying a person’s voice — whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording — based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances that connect it with the alleged speaker.
6. **Evidence About a Telephone Conversation.** For a telephone conversation, evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time to: (A) a particular person, if circumstances, including self-identification, show that the person answering was the one called; or (B) a particular business, if the call was made to a business and the call related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
7. **Evidence About Public Records.** Evidence that: (A) a document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law; or (B) a purported public record or statement is from the office where items of this kind are kept.
8. **Evidence About Ancient Documents or Data Compilations.** For a document or data compilation, evidence that it: (A) is in a condition that creates no suspicion about its authenticity; (B) was in a place where, if authentic, it would likely be; and (C) is at least 20 years old when offered.
9. **Evidence About a Process or System.** Evidence describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate result.
10. **Methods Provided By a Statute or Rule.** Any method of authentication or identification allowed by a federal statute or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.

## Rule 902 – Evidence That Is Self-Authenticating

The following items of evidence are self-authenticating; they require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted:

#### (1) **Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed**.&#x20;

A document that bears: (A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state, district, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of the United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of any of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of any entity named above; and (B) a signature purporting to be an execution or attestation.

#### (2) **Domestic Public Documents That Are Not Sealed but Are Signed and Certified**.&#x20;

A document that bears no seal if: (A) it bears the signature of an officer or employee of an entity named in Rule 902(1)(A); and (B) another public officer who has a seal and official duties within that same entity certifies under seal — or its equivalent — that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.

#### (3) **Foreign Public Documents**.&#x20;

A document that purports to be signed or attested by a person who is authorized by a foreign country’s law to do so. The document must be accompanied by a final certification that certifies the genuineness of the signature and official position of the signer or attester — or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the signature or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the signature or attestation.&#x20;

The certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If all parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to investigate the document’s authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either: (A) order that it be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification; or (B) allow it to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.

#### (4) **Certified Copies of Public Records**.&#x20;

A copy of an official record — or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law — if the copy is certified as correct by: (A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification; or (B) a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a federal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.

#### (5) **Official Publications**.&#x20;

A book, pamphlet, or other publication purporting to be issued by a public authority.

#### (6) **Newspapers and Periodicals**.&#x20;

Printed material purporting to be a newspaper or periodical.

#### (7) **Trade Inscriptions and the Like**.&#x20;

An inscription, sign, tag, or label purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating origin, ownership, or control.

#### (8) **Acknowledged Documents**.&#x20;

A document accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment that is lawfully executed by a notary public or another officer who is authorized to take acknowledgments.

#### (9) **Commercial Paper and Related Documents**.&#x20;

Commercial paper, a signature on it, and related documents, to the extent allowed by general commercial law.

#### (10) **Presumptions Under a Federal Statute**.&#x20;

A signature, document, or anything else that a federal statute declares to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.

#### (11) **Certified Domestic Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity**.&#x20;

The original or a copy of a domestic record that meets the requirements of [Rule 803](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-viii/rule-803/)(6)(A)-(C), as shown by a certification of the custodian or another qualified person that complies with a federal statute or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court. Before the trial or hearing, the proponent must give an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to offer the record — and must make the record and certification available for inspection — so that the party has a fair opportunity to challenge them.

#### (12) **Certified Foreign Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity**.&#x20;

In a civil case, the original or a copy of a foreign record that meets the requirements of Rule 902(11), modified as follows: the certification, rather than complying with a federal statute or Supreme Court rule, must be signed in a manner that, if falsely made, would subject the maker to a criminal penalty in the country where the certification is signed. The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).

#### (13) **Certified Records Generated by an Electronic Process or System**.&#x20;

A record generated by an electronic process or system that produces an accurate result, as shown by a certification of a qualified person that complies with the certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12). The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).

#### (14) **Certified Data Copied from an Electronic Device, Storage Medium, or File**.&#x20;

Data copied from an electronic device, storage medium, or file, if authenticated by a process of digital identification, as shown by a certification of a qualified person that complies with the certification requirements of Rule 902(11) or (12). The proponent also must meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).
