# Dead Man's Statute

A Dead Man's Statute states that,** in a civil action**, a party with an interest in the litigation may not testify against a dead party about communications with the dead party. The Federal Rules of Evidence does not contain a Dead Man's Statute, however, many states have adopted a Dead Man's Statute in their evidence rules.

The restriction can be waived. A waiver can occur in a number of ways:&#x20;

1. The decedent's representative fails to object to the testimony;
2. The decedent's own representative testifies to the communication;
3. The decedent's testimony is brought before the jury in the form of a deposition or in another form.

With respect to U.S. federal courts, Rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defers to state law the determination of whether a witness is competent to testify.
