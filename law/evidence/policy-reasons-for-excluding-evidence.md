# Policy Reasons for Excluding Evidence

## Offers of Compromise

Purpose:  to further the public policy favoring compromise and the settlement of disputes.

### Fed. R. Evid. 408 (a) Prohibited Uses

Evidence of the following is not admissible to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:

**(1)** **Settlements:** furnishing, promising, or offering — or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept — a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and

**(2)** **Plea Negotiations:** conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the claim — except when offered in a criminal case and when the negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.

### Fed. R. Evid. 408 **(b) Exceptions**&#x20;

The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.

### Strout v. Maine Medical Center

A doctor misdiagnosed his patient with a far more lethal form of cancer than the patient actually had.&#x20;

#### The "Apology Statute"

In any civil action for medical professional negligence: any statement, affirmation, gesture or conduct expressing apology, sympathy, commiseration, condolence, compassion or a general sense of benevolence relating to the discomfort, pain, suffering, injury or death of the alleged victim as the result of the unanticipated outcome is inadmissible as evidence of an admission of liability or as evidence of an admission against interest.&#x20;

#### Statements of Fault

However,** statements of fault are admissible**, even when coupled with other statements that may be inadmissible. Here, the letter from the Main medical center revealed that the doctor did not follow protocol, although he was acting in good faith. &#x20;

There is no evidence of any disputed claim in existence at the time of the admission. The statements contained in the letter were not made as part of a settlement negotiation or mediation.

### Anderson v. Midland Lutheran

Andersen, a nursing student, was dismissed from Midland Lutheran College. He claims the dismissal was a result of discrimination due to his ADHD.&#x20;

The parties' evidentiary dispute surrounds Dr. Sasse's letter to Andersen offering Andersen readmission to complete his nursing degree requirements. In the letter, Dr. Sasse stated, "the offer \[of readmission] is made in recognition of \[Andersen's] previous quality academic record..." Andersen sought to use this letter as evidence to support the notion that he had been improperly dismissed from the school.&#x20;

Under Rule 408 (a), Midland seeks to preclude Andersen from presenting all evidence of or argument about negotiations and offers to compromise between the parties and all proceedings before the United States Department of Education (DOE). Midland argues the legtter was made in attempt to settle Andersen's claims as part of settlement negotiations and should not be admissible to show pretext for discrimination (an element of Andersen's claim).&#x20;

#### So, is readmission to Midland sufficient consideration to be protected under Rule 408(a)?&#x20;

The court referenced the following cases in the opinion.

#### _Burns: _

Burns was discharged from the railroad retroactively effective the day before he was summoned for the investigation which lead to his dismissal. Burns requested his wages and expenses for the period between the summoning and discharge but the railroad refused.&#x20;

The court held "refusal to pay an undoubted obligation when due \[to a discharged employee] is not a basis for such a dispute as to constitute a consideration for settlement by way of compromise of another claim not included in the obligation. There must have been an actual bona fide difference or dispute between the parties."

#### _**Spiering:**_

A police captain faced termination for exercising First Amendment rights and signed an agreement accepting a demotion in an effort to remain employed. The agreement Spiering signed lacked consideration and Spiering did not waive his right to sue the defendants because Spiering had an "indisputable right" to remain in the captain's position and exercise his right to speech.

The court held "consideration for a release requires mutual concessions, and a release is not supported by sufficient consideration unless plaintiff received something of value to which he had no previous right."

#### But the plaintiffs in Burns and Spiering had already signed settlement agreements and the issue there was whether the plaintiffs forfeited their rights to file suit.&#x20;

Andersen's readmission to Midland is not an "undoubted obligation" or "indisputable right." Andersen's belief that he is entitled to readmission does not render Midland's offer without consideration and is not a proper basis to admit settlement communications under Rule 408.

Andersen has not identified which witnesses have a bias or prejudice against Andersen or how the letter would show bias or prejudice. Andersen is attempting to admit evidence of settlement communication to show Andersen is capable of performing the essential functions of a nurse and Andersen's dismissal was a pretext for discrimination. These are elements of Andersen's claim against Midland and Rule 408 bars admission of settlement communication to prove a claim.

#### To admit Midland's settlement offer would violate Rule 408. Dr. Sasse's June 25, 2010 letter is also inadmissible under the Rule 408(b) exceptions.&#x20;

## Offers to Pay Medical and Similar Expenses

### Fed. R. Evid. 409

This is a policy issue. Evidence of furnishing, promising to pay, or offering to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses resulting from an injury is **not admissible** to prove liability for the injury. The courts do not want to dissuade parties from seeking amicable settlements and thus avoiding litigation.&#x20;

### Rhodes v. B.C. Moore & Son, Inc.

Appellant was stung by a bee, yellow jacket or other insect while shopping. Appellant contends that a store employee was present and saw the insect immediately after it stung her. However, Appellant has not shown the presence of insects; nor has Appellant demonstrated the existence of previous bug attacks in the store. Furthermore, the employee witness called upon by the Appellant denied ever seeing an insect in the store and could not recall whether a sting had ever occurred prior.&#x20;

Appellant received medical attention twice for the sting and the store (Appellee) paid for at least one of the visits. Appellant sought to introduce this as evidence to support a claim of negligence against the store. But the court does not want to discourage charity or acts in good faith to avoid litigation.&#x20;

#### Holding:

#### "This type of activity constituting a voluntary offer of assistance made on the impulse of benevolence or sympathy should be encouraged and should not be considered as an admission of liability." [Gray v. Delta Air Lines, 127 Ga. App. 45, 53 (192 SE2d 521)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=104058341783244176\&hl=en\&q=264+SE2d+500) (1972).&#x20;

## Negotiations in Criminal Trials

### Fed. R. Evid. 410 Plea Negotiations

In criminal cases, plea bargain negotiations are inadmissible as evidence because prosecutors want to ensure the longevity and reliability of informant relationships, especialy when trying to break a large criminal conspiracy.

#### **(a) Prohibited Uses.** In a civil or criminal case, evidence of the following is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea or participated in the plea discussions:

**(1)** a guilty plea that was later withdrawn; **(2)** a nolo contendere plea; **(3)** a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule\_11) or a comparable state procedure; or **(4)** a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-withdrawn guilty plea.

#### **(b) Exceptions.** The court may admit a statement described in [Rule 410(a)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule\_410#rule\_410\_a\_3) or [(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule\_410#rule\_410\_a\_4):

**(1)** in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if in fairness the statements ought to be considered together; or **(2)** in a criminal proceeding for _perjury or false statement_, if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.

### U.S. v. Mezzanato

#### Whether the defendant can validly waive his right to have the evidence of his pre-trial meeting with prosecutors admitted into evidence. (Rule 410). This case represents an exception to the general rule.

On October 17, 1991, respondent and his attorney met with the prosecutor to negotiate a potential plea deal. At the beginning of the meeting, the prosecutor informed respondent that he had no obligation to talk, but that if he wanted to cooperate he would have to be completely truthful. As a condition to proceeding with the discussion, the prosecutor indicated that respondent would have to agree that any statements he made during the meeting could be used to impeach any contradictory testimony he might give at trial if the case proceeded that far. Respondent conferred with his counsel and agreed to proceed under the prosecutor's terms.

Prosecutors may be especially reluctant to negotiate without a waiver agreement during the early stages of a criminal investigation, when prosecutors are searching for leads and suspects may be willing to offer information in exchange for some form of immunity or leniency in sentencing. In this "cooperation" context, prosecutors face "painfully delicate" choices as to "whether to proceed and prosecute those suspects against whom the already produced evidence makes a case or whether to extend leniency or full immunity to some suspects in order to procure testimony against other, more dangerous suspects against whom existing evidence is flimsy or nonexistent."

#### Reasoning and Holding

The admission of plea statements for impeachment purposes enhances the truthseeking function of trials and will result in more accurate verdicts.

There is no reason to believe that allowing negotiation as to waiver of the plea-statement Rules will bring plea bargaining to a grinding halt; it may well have the opposite effect.

While confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly (by admitting evidence of plea bargains) may have a discouraging effect on the defendant's assertion of trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices is an inevitable and permissible attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.

#### We hold that **absent some affirmative indication that the agreement was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily**, an agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions of the plea-statement Rules is valid and enforceable.

## Insurance Coverage

### Fed. R. Evid. 411 Liability Insurance

Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice or proving agency, ownership, or control.

### Osborne v. Wenger

Civil case. Wenger was drunk driving and struck Osborne on her way home. The jury was prevented from learning whether Wenger was insured. Given that Wenger admitted liability, there was a strong possibility that the disclosure of the one million dollar coverage limits on Wenger's policy would influence the jury's finding as to compensatory damages. Evidence of insurance coverage is generally not admissible, although there are exceptions. [Duke's GMC, Inc. v. Erskine (1983), Ind. App., 447 N.E.2d 1118](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=17615352030255658282\&hl=en\&q=572+NE.2d+1343).&#x20;

There was also a claim for punitive damages. Punitive damages are linked to the defendant's net worth and will vary based on the defendant's capacity to compensate the counterparty. The financial status of a defendant is admissible for the purpose of determining what amount of punitive damages would be appropriate to punish and deter him. [Archem, Inc. v. Simo (1990), Ind. App., 549 N.E.2d 1054, 1058](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=18331292346068465869\&hl=en\&q=572+NE.2d+1343).
