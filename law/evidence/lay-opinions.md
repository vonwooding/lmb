## Rule 701 – Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses

If a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to one that is: (a) rationally based on the witness’s perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness’s testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of [Rule 702](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-vii/rule-702/).

## Whidby v. Columbine Carrier

Virginia and Glen Whidby brought a wrongful death action against the driver Marion A. Williams, the owner and the insurer of the tractor trailer truck that killed their daughter Janet.&#x20;

Marion struck Janet Whidby's vehicle at the intersection of Highway 96 and Moody Road. A stop sign and blinking red light faced Moody Road where she attempted to enter the intersection northbound. There was no stop sign on Highway 96, nor any stoplight, but there was a caution light, and there was a bend or curve of the road on Highway 96 as it approached Moody Road.&#x20;

It had been raining or was raining at the time of the collision. Plaintiffs contend that Marion was driving too fast for the conditions. Plaintiffs appealed following a jury verdict for defendants, stating that the trial court erred in excluding the officer's opinion testimony in which he claimed that defendant Marion was traveling at 75-80mph.&#x20;

The officer arrived at the scene at 11:17 p. m., shortly after the collision occurred. He testified the rain had "been coming down" before he arrived but had slowed to a sprinkle when he got to the scene, and 30 minutes later it began coming down hard again.&#x20;

The officer's opinion, based on training and experience in judging the degree of damage done to the vehicles and the distance they traveled after impact, was not a "mathematical calculation," but the law of evidence does not require an opinion as to speed to be a mathematical calculation to be admissible.&#x20;

Police officers who are experienced in investigating collisions may give an opinion as to speed based on physical evidence as to how far the vehicles traveled after impact and the damage incurred after impact, even though the officers did not see the collision, may not have shown that they had learning and experience to qualify themselves as experts, and even where one stated he did not consider himself an expert.
