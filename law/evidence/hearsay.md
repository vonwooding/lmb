# Hearsay

## Hearsay vs. Non-Hearsay

### Rule 801 (**a**) **Statement and (b) Declarant**

\*\*A statement \*\*is a **declarants’s** oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.

### Rule 801 (c) **Hearsay**

Hearsay is an out of court statement that: (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

### Rule 801 (d) **Exceptions**

#### **Statements that are not hearsay:**

A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement is admissible when inconsistent with that witness's prior testimony given under penalty of perjury. (impeachment)

A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement is admissible when consistent with that witness's prior testimony when offered to show the witness knew something on a particular date or to rehabilitate the credibility of a witness.

An opposing party's statement is admissible when made by the party in an individual or representative capacity; manifestly and believed to be true; made by an authorized person (agent, employee within the scope of relationship); or made by the party's coconspirator during and in furturance of the conspiracy.

## Out of Court Declaration Offered for the Truth

### Miller v. State

Miller had been arrested for murder and the police took and transcribed his statement. Lots of indicia that the statement is reliable. Miller's lawyer sought to introduce the transcript as evidence, but the court does not permit the defendant's statement. The defendant wants to introduce a transcript of an out of court discussion with the officer. The court prevented admission of the transcript because it would effectively allow a defendant to avoid cross examination.

## Not Offered for the Truth of the Matter Asserted

### Com v. Silanskas

Defendant killed David with help from Lilian.

On December 29, 1995, Lillian told a waitress that she was engaged to the defendant and would be marrying him on Valentine's Day. She explained that her husband, David, had recently left to join a monastery in Maine. In reality, David's body was located in Lilian's basement deep freezer. When an officer asked Lilian if her husband was home, she called for cuck boy defendant rather than unthawing her real husband. These statements clearly were not offered for their truth.

Can we admit a defendant's lie? Yes, we can offer the statements as evidence of intent to concoct a lie, helping the prosecution prove its case. But keep in mind this is not evidence that Lilian's husband actually moved to Maine for a monestary. The statements hold probative value supporting Lilian's malintent to obscure the investigation into David's death and avoid trouble.

## Implied Assertion

### US v. Zenni

The definition of hearsay requires that a statement intended as an assertion. "Hello, I would like a pizza." lacks intent to inform others that the phone number belongs to a pizza shop. I might be incidentally conveying to people that its a pizza shop, but that statement is very different than "Hello, this is a pizza shop." The desire is to order a pizza, not to convey that this is a pizza shop.

"Hello, I would like a pizza" is an implied assertion and could support an inference that the shop is a in fact a pizza shop. Implied assertions/admissions are sometimes inadmissible.

"Hello, this is a pizza shop" would be hearsay to prove that the shop is in fact a pizza shop because it goes to prove the truth of the matter and is not an implied assertion.

### US v. Jackson
