# Privileges

## Rule 501 - Privileges Generally

The common law — as interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience — governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following provides otherwise:

* the United States Constitution;
* a federal statute; or
* rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.

But in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.

## Rule 502 – Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver

The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.

#### **(a) Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a Federal Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver**.&#x20;

When the disclosure is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a federal or state proceeding only if:

1. the waiver is intentional;&#x20;
2. the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter; and
3. they ought in fairness to be considered together.

#### **(b) Inadvertent Disclosure**.&#x20;

When made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal or state proceeding if:

1. the disclosure is inadvertent;
2. the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and
3. the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error, including (if applicable) following [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b)(5)(B)](https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-v-disclosures-and-discovery/rule-26-duty-to-disclose-general-provisions-governing-discovery/).

#### **(c) Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding.**&#x20;

When the disclosure is made in a state proceeding and is not the subject of a state-court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal proceeding if the disclosure:

1. would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made in a federal proceeding; or
2. is not a waiver under the law of the state where the disclosure occurred.

#### **(d) Controlling Effect of a Court Order.**&#x20;

A federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court — in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state proceeding.

#### **(e) Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement.**&#x20;

An agreement on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.

#### **(f) Controlling Effect of this Rule.**&#x20;

Notwithstanding [Rules 101](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-i/rule-101/) and [1101](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-xi/rule-1101/), this rule applies to state proceedings and to federal court-annexed and federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if state law provides the rule of decision.

#### **(g) Definitions**.&#x20;

> “attorney-client privilege” means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications
>
> “work-product protection” means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial

## Outline Of Privileges

For privileges, codified at Fed. R. Evid. 501 and 502, you should recognize the following questions are in play and be able to analyze the answers to them:

1. Does a privilege potentially exist for communications between the people involved?
   1. Is it one recognized by statute, as with Pennsylvania's doctor-patient privilege?
   2. Is there a common law privilege that potentially covers these parties, i.e., spouses?
   3. Is there a policy-based justification for a privilege to emerge from elsewhere, i.e., the effort to create a self-policing privilege?
2. Was the communication only between parties who enjoy the privilege of confidential communications, or has the information been shared with third parties?  If so, what is the consequence for the privilege?
3. Do privileged communications remain privileged in a lawsuit between the parties to the communication involving the subject of the communication?
4. Is one of the parties to a privileged communication capable of testifying against the other party in a criminal case, or a civil case against a party not a part of the privileged communication?  Another way of asking this is, who is the holder of the privilege?
