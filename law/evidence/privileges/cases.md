## Bennett v. CIT Bank

This dispute is over insurance proceeds. Plaintiffs Jeanette Bennett's and Maggie Bell filed a motion to compel Defendants CIT Bank to produce documents. CIT had shared emails with Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) that contained legal advice from their respective counsel.

CIT did not submit the emails during discovery. Rather, they claimed attorney-client privilege. But Plaintiffs moved the court to compel CIT to produce the emails claiming that CIT and Fannie Mae waived the attorney-client privilege when they shared the emails with each other.&#x20;

A client who “voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter” or "shares confidential communications made between him and his attorney with non-client third parties" risks waiving the attorney-client privilege.

#### Common Interest Doctrine

The Common Interest Doctrine will protect a party that has waived its attorney-client privilege by disclosing privileged communications with a third party.&#x20;

The Common Interest Doctrine applies “when the third person \[which whom the confidential information was shared] is also a client as to the subject matters discussed in the conference **or** has a sufficient common legal interest in the subject matters discussed.”

Here, the court will deny Plaintiff's motion to compel because CIT and Fannie Mae shared a common legal interest in defending their legal rights to the insurance proceeds at issue in this case. The Common Interest Doctrine exception to the waiver of attorney-client privilege applies. Motion to compel production denied.&#x20;
