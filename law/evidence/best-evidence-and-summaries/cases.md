## United States v. Diaz-Lopez

Diaz contends that, under Federal Rule of Evidence 1002, the government was required to produce an "original" to show that the CLAIMS database did not contain any record of Diaz having filed an I-212.&#x20;

The best evidence rule "requires not, as its common name implies, the best evidence in every case but rather the production of an original document instead of a copy." This rule has also been enlarged to include not just writings, but also recordings and photographs. it is to be considered&#x20;

1. that there has been substantial hazard of inaccuracy in some of the commonly utilized methods of making copies of writings, and&#x20;
2. Oral testimony purporting to give the terms of a writing from memory is probably subject to a greater risk of error than oral testimony concerning other situations generally.&#x20;

In writings, the smallest variation in words may be of importance. Thus the rule applies only to the terms of the document, and not to any other facts about the document.&#x20;

The rule does not apply to exclude testimony which concerns the document without aiming to establish its terms.&#x20;

When records or data are stored "in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an \`original.'"&#x20;

Diaz is correct that the CLAIMS database falls within the scope of the best evidence rule, because the database is a "writing or recording set down by magnetic impulse or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation." The next question is whether the evidence was introduced "\[t]o prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph."&#x20;

We conclude that it was not. Our decision here does not conflict with our holding in United States v. Bennett, 363 F.3d 947 (9th Cir.2004). There, we held that testimony about data retrieved from a boat's global positioning system ("GPS") was barred by the best evidence rule because the testimony had been introduced to prove the "content" of the GPS, which, in turn, was evidence that the defendant had come from Mexico. Id. at 953. But Bennett concerned testimony about the contents of the GPS data, not testimony about the absence of data. We reached that decision because the testimony about the GPS data was introduced to prove its content

We hold that Federal Rule of Evidence 1002 is inapplicable to the agent's testimony that his search of the CLAIMS database revealed no record of a Form I-212 filed by Diaz.

## United States v. Bray

Defendant, James A. Bray, appeals from the judgment entered following a jury trial in which he was convicted of embezzling approximately $20,000 during the course of his employment with the United States Postal Service.

&#x20;He argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting exhibits that summarized voluminous underlying documents without admitting the underlying documentation and without giving a limiting instruction.

We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion and, thus, affirm the defendant's convictions. Defendant participated in a scheme to steal cash given by customers.

Money collected each day at a post office is reported on a 1412 Form. The government in this case elected to admit as evidence a summary of all the 1412 forms rather than the voluminous forms themselves.&#x20;

Rule 1006 The same principle would render inadmissible a summary based on documents that are inadmissible for any other reason, such as irrelevancy, unfair prejudice, or lack of authenticity The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.&#x20;

The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties. The court may order that they be produced in court. It is not necessary that the documents be so voluminous as to be "literally impossible to examine."

The documents (or recordings or photographs) must be so "voluminous" that they "cannot conveniently be examined in court" by the trier of fact. That is, the documents must be sufficiently numerous as to make comprehension "difficult and inconvenient."&#x20;

In this instance, the summary, and not the underlying documents, is the evidence to be considered by the factfinder. Since, in this case, it is clear that the summaries at issue are within the first of the three categories we have described, and were admitted under Rule 1006, the district court's refusal to give a limiting instruction in its final instructions to the jury was proper. There was no error, let alone reversible error. To be sure, the district court mistakenly gave a limiting instruction sua sponte when it admitted the government's summaries, but this error was one that favored Bray. Obviously, it provides no basis for overturning his convictions.
