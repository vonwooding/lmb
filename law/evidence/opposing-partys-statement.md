# Opposing Party's Statement

## Made by Party in Individual or Representative Capacity

Rule 801(d)(1)(2)**(A)**

**801(d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay.** A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:

**(2) **_**An Opposing Party’s Statement**_**.** The statement is offered against an opposing party and **(A)** was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity.

### Estate of Shafer v. IRS

Shafer sons (Chase and Arthur) inherited land form their father, Shafer Sr. but the amount of land owned by the estate, and therefore the amount due to the IRS in back taxes, was unclear. The sons claim that the father did not owned the land and they owe no taxes. In order to collect from the sons, the IRS wants to introduce an affidavit that had previously been provided by the sons. That affidavit contained quoted claims of ownership by Shafer Sr.&#x20;

The Sons now wish to claw back that document on the grounds that the affadavit is an out of court statement offered to prove the fact of the matter asserted. &#x20;

&#x20;801(d)(2)(B) provides that a statement by a **party **may be admissible when it is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true.  The sons of Shafer are parties to this litigation as is Shafer as the estate owner.&#x20;

There are separate hearsay exceptions for the affadavit itself and the purported claims of a third party contained within, as stated by the court: **"In order to be admissible, both levels of statements within the affidavits must be excluded from the hearsay definition." **

There are two levels of evidence in this case. (1) The affadavit itself and (2) the claims of Shafer Sr. which the affadavit purports to represent .

The court explained why Shafer Sr's admissions contained in the son's affadavit are not hearsay: **"No modern court doubts that a decedent, whose rights are transmitted intact to his successor, is a person whose admissions are receivable against a party claiming the decedent's rights as heir, executor, or administrator." **

## Adoptive Admission&#x20;

Rule 801(d)(1)(2)(B)

**A statement is not hearsay when offered against an opposing party that manifested that the party adopted or believed the statement to be true.**

When someone else makes a statement and the party affirms the staement, that can be used against the party. Moreover, if someone incriminates another in a manner that would typically illicit a response, and the incriminated party does not actively refute the claim, that silence may be offered as evidence. &#x20;

### Com. v. Babbitt

Rosado and Babbitt beat a black man to death. Afterwards, Rosado tells David and several others on the bus (he claimed to have informed 100 people), about how he and Babbitt had beat a black man to death. Dolan testified and Hayward testified and Bilsborough even saw the body. All claimed that Rosado bragged while accounts of Babbitt varied. Some reported that Babbitt was silent at times and other times he would also brag.

There are two exceptions to hearsay here. First, the duo admitted to the crime, which is admissible as a prior party statement. Second, although Babbitt was silent at times, his silence was an adoptive admission to the crime. Rosado's statements of Babbitt's conduct were so abhorrenet that any reasonable person would have attempted to refute.

### State v. Matthews

Mathews and Long beat and rob a dominoes pizza driver. They returned to Longs house and he began to tell his fiance about the crime. Although Matthews looked perturbed during Long's recountenance, he remained silent.

Afterwards, Matthews and Long demonstrated the choke hold that they used to restrain the pizza delivery driver during the robbery and assault. Matthew's silence and participation in the choke hold demonstration operate as an adoptive admission to the crime and therefore admissible as evidence.&#x20;

## Authorized Admissions&#x20;

Rule 801(d)(1)(2)(C)

When is a person authorized to make a statement on another's behalf?

### Kingsley v. Baker

AR jackson was the supervisor of plaintiff kingslet. King was told by jackson that if he did not resign he would be fired and that AR jackson would withhold a positive review for future employers and that it would be better to resign. If he is fired, then Brachnut has to pay him a severence package.&#x20;

King chose not to resign because he would prefer the severance package. He wanted to introduce evidence in the form of testimony from another worker. The other worker overheard AR Jackson on a ohone call say "dont worry about paying his severance, ill make him quit."&#x20;

Beachnut company said thats hearsay - it was overhard by a third person its inadmissible. But the court said no, this was anauthorized admission. How did beachnut authorize AR jackson to make this decision?&#x20;

Well, AR jackson was Kings supervisor and therefore anything that AR says about kings' employment is wihin AR's role and therefore expressly authorized by Beachnut company. &#x20;

## Statements by Party’s Agent or Employee&#x20;

Rule 801(d)(1)(2)(D)

**801(d) **A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay: ** (2) **_**An Opposing Party’s Statement**_**.** The statement is offered against an opposing party and:** (D)** was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or

### Powers v. Coccia

In her negligence suit, Powers alleged that defendant's failure to maintain the premises resulted in bird mite infestation that caused illness to her and her children.

The plaintiffs argued that the trial justice in the negligence action erred when she denied plaintiffs' effort to introduce certain documents that defendant filed in the security deposit action.&#x20;

Those documents included defendant's affidavit, which incorporated statements that New England Pest Control, Interstate Pest Control, and Critter Control made to him, as well as documents that were incorporated by reference in the affidavit from the pest control companies and a representative of J & M Construction Company.

The plaintiffs . . . maintain that certain documents submitted to Coccia, consisting of service agreements and invoices that were incorporated by reference into his affidavit, are admissible as statements made by his agents.&#x20;

Under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) statements made "by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the party's agency or employment" are not hearsay. "Rule 801(d)(2)(D) requires that an agency or employment relationship must have existed between the declarant and the party

## Co-Conspirator Statement&#x20;

Rule 801(d)(1)(2)(E)

**(d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay.** A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:**  (2) **_**An Opposing Party’s Statement**_**.** The statement is offered against an opposing party and: **(E)** was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.

**Extrajudicial statements of coconspirators or joint criminal venturers may be admissible against the others involved if the existence of the conspiracy or joint venture has been shown by other evidence.**

### Com. v. Cruz&#x20;

\[Mequidia] Cruz, \[Jaime] Gonzalez, and \[Carlos] Villar were arrested by police in Cruz's apartment. In total, police recovered nearly 300 grams of cocaine from the apartment. \[Berto] Solano was arrested three days later. During a search of his vehicle pursuant to a warrant, police discovered an electronically controlled secret compartment which could be used for hiding and transporting cocaine.

Villar and Solano claim that the trial judge erred in admitting extrajudicial statements by Gonzalez because there was insufficient evidence other than Gonzalez's statements to establish their participation in a criminal joint venture with Gonzalez. **The Court disagreed.**

The Commonwealth must satisfy the judge by a preponderance of the evidence that a criminal joint venture took place between the declarant and the defendant before the declarant's statements can be admitted as proof of the joint venture. The statements must also have been made during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.

### Bourjaily v. U.S.

Petitioner was charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 846, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841(a)(1). The Government introduced, over petitioner's objection, Angelo Lonardo's telephone statements regarding the participation of the "friend" in the transaction. Petitioner's theory ignores two simple facts of evidentiary life.&#x20;

First, out-of-court statements are only presumed unreliable. The presumption may be rebutted by appropriate proof. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(24) (otherwise inadmissible hearsay may be admitted if circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness demonstrated).&#x20;

Second, individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it. The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts. Taken together, these two propositions demonstrate that a piece of evidence, unreliable in isolation, may become quite probative when corroborated by other evidence.

Each one of Lonardo's statements may itself be unreliable, but taken as a whole, the entire conversation between Lonardo and Greathouse was corroborated by independent evidence. The friend, who turned out to be petitioner, showed up at the prearranged spot at the prearranged time. He picked up the cocaine, and a significant sum of money was found in his car.

### U.S. v. Magluta

### Andrew v. State

Brenda Andrew, had James Pravatt (with whom she was having an affair) kill her husband.  Statements Pravatt made to his daughter were admitted as being in furtherance of the conspiracy.  This ruling quite liberally interprets the term "in furtherance of the conspiracy.
