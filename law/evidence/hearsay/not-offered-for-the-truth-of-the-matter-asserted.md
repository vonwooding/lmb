# Not Offered for the Truth of the Matter Asserted

## Rule 801(c)(2)&#x20;

A statement that is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted is not excluded by the rule against hearsay.

[Silanskas Case](../#commonwealth-v.-silanskas)

The statement that her husband went and joined the monastery can be entered by anyone who heard her say this because it is not being offered for the truth. In fact, it is being entered for the exact opposite reason, to show that it is inconsistent with what really happened.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### When the statement is not provided for the truth of the matter asserted:

Everyone ran out of a building because a person yelled "FIRE”&#x20;

The statement can be brought in to show why everyone ran out of the building, but not to prove that a fire actually existed.
{% endhint %}



## Implied Assertion

### The Pizza Example

{% hint style="info" %}
Someone picks up the phone and orders a pepperoni pizza, there is an implicit assertion that he is calling a pizza place. That person is implicitly asserting that the place sells pizza.
{% endhint %}

### Zenni Case

“Put two dollars on Paul Revere in the third” is implicitly saying that the place being called is in fact a gambling establishment. Although this statement was implicit, it was not intended as an assertion, and therefore, does not meet the definition of hearsay.&#x20;

* Not a verbal act because it is not at issue
* The gambling parlor is not suing the caller for the two-dollar bet
* Not attempting to prove a contract
* Not attempting to prove how the caller changed the world or how the world was changed as a result of his activity &#x20;

### Jackson Case

“Don’t do it, Kenny” and “Is this Kenny?”

* Was not used to announce that the person was in fact Kenny
* Speaker is indifferent as to whether people understood from his statement that he was speaking to Kenny

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### An Implied assertion **is not hearsay** unless the declarant **intended the content to be an assertion**
{% endhint %}

## Verbal Acts

A verbal act is performed through the medium of words. It can be spoken or written and is direct evidence, not hearsay. There is no truth in a verbal act.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### By merely speaking certain things, you have changed the nature of the world by commanding it to be so.&#x20;

* By saying, “Deliver a pepperoni pizza to my house” you have changed the nature of the world by merely speaking.&#x20;
* There is no truth content to this statement; this is not a falsifiable claim; it is neither true nor false.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### State v. Weaver

> “Will you take money to look the other way?”&#x20;

The defendant is soliciting a bribe (changing the nature of the world/words of consequence), which is a verbal act. The statement can be offered to show the consequences/effort to bring about those consequences, not for the truth of the matter asserted. The State offered Blakeney's statements, not for the truth of the matter asserted in those statements, but rather to prove that Blakeney spoke words that amounted to an offer of a bribe. When offered for that purpose, the statements do not amount to hearsay.

### Schindler v. Seiler

> “He’s a bad doctor.”&#x20;

Slanderous statement that was overheard is not hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. This statement was not being brought in to show that he is a bad doctor, but to show that this statement was a slanderous statement.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
BUT “Jim said that Bob is a bad doctor” is hearsay. There is a truth value to this statement and it can be falsified.
{% endhint %}

### US v. Pang

A written check is a verbal act because it changes the nature of the world and causes an immediate consequence. The bank will take the money out of the account and give it to someone else. Jere, the check was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather for your effort to move money from one place to another.&#x20;

## Knowledge

### Safeway Stores v. Combs

> “Look out for the ketchup!”&#x20;

Could be considered a verbal act (“Look out/Be careful”). The person who slipped on the ketchup had advance notice that the ketchup was on the floor and should have taken steps/adequate precaution to not slip in it. This statement was not offered to show whether there was ketchup on the floor or not, but to show that the plaintiff had knowledge about the ketchup.&#x20;

## Effect on Hearer

### Doctor Example

{% hint style="info" %}
A defendant in a vehicular homicide case wants to testify that he was informed by his doctor that he had only one year to live. After he heard the news, he went on a bender and got very drunk, went driving, and crashed into another car which killed the driver.

* The defendant can testify as to what his doctor told him because it explains why he went on the bender.
{% endhint %}

### Suggs v. Stanley

Two sisters called the police to report that someone was in their brother’s house (his girlfriend).

> “There’s someone in the house!"

This is normally hearsay because it is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. But in this case, it is not being used to show that she was actually in the house, but to show why the police showed up at the house. This statement was admissible because it was offered to show why someone did something. It was used to show how the police responded to the situation. In response to the call, the police showed up.&#x20;

### US v. Herrera

> “I will kick your ass”&#x20;

This statement was not considered hearsay because it was not offered to show that the declarant intended to or actually beat Herrera up. Rather, this statement was offered to show that Herrera was concerned that this would actually occur if she failed to carry out the task. It effected her in such a manner that made her comply with the declarant's wishes. &#x20;
