# Prior Statements

## Prior Inconsistent Statements

Rule 801(d)(1)(A)

### Truman

Refusal to testify is inconsistent with testimony that was previously given.&#x20;

### Sua

Witnesses previously signed statements that were inconsistent with what they were saying during trial. The statements were not made under penalty of perjury and under oath; the statements were just given to the police officers.

#### **Substantive Evidence**

The inconsistent statements must be signed under oath, under penalty of perjury, and during a trial, deposition or other proceedings.&#x20;

#### **Impeachment Evidence**

A jury cannot convict a person of a crime if the only evidence they have of the crime comes in as impeachment evidence. Prior inconsistent statements in this case would be used as impeachment evidence.

## Prior Consistent Statements (Rule 801(d)(1)(B))

A consistent statement offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive must have been made before the alleged fabrication or improper influence or motive arose.

Driver A claims that the car that caused the accident was red, and the driver of the blue car attempts to bribe Driver A to say that the car that caused the accident was red.



During trial, Driver A once again says the car was red. Driver A was saying the car was red prior to the bribe.&#x20;

Prior consistent statements otherwise admissible for rehabilitation are now admissible substantively as well. Additionally, a prior consistent statement must satisfy the Rule 403 balancing test.
