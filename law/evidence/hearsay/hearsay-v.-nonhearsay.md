# Hearsay v. Nonhearsay

## Verbal Acts

### State v. Weaver

Defendant Ronald Weaver was convicted for bribing a public officer. He argues on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting the out-of-court statements of his co-defendant offering the alleged bribe.

Defendant was convicted under N.C. Gen.Stat. ยง 14-218 (2001), which provides: "If any person shall offer a bribe, whether it be accepted or not, he shall be punished as a Class F felon." To prove that a person has offered a bribe, the State must necessarily offer evidence that words amounting to a bribe were spoken. The State offered Blakeney's statements not for the truth of the matter asserted in those statements, but rather to prove that Blakeney spoke words that amounted to an offer of a bribe. When offered for that purpose, the statements do not amount to hearsay. See [State v. Kirkman, 293 N.C. 447, 455, 238 S.E.2d 456, 461 (1977)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=10228035448022091429\&hl=en\&q=584+se2d+345) ("The Hearsay Rule does not preclude a witness from testifying as to a statement made by another person when the purpose of the evidence is not to show the truth of such statement but merely to show that the statement was, in fact, made."); [State v. Grier, 51 N.C.App. 209, 214, 275 S.E.2d 560, 563 (1981)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=15237761261948782004\&hl=en\&q=584+se2d+345) ("Notable examples of admissible non-hearsay include statements which are offered to prove only that the statement was actually made...."); [State v. Cleveland, 51 N.C.App. 159, 160, 275 S.E.2d 284, 285 (1981)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar\_case?as\_sdt=6%2C39\&case=9318845785328623906\&hl=en\&q=584+se2d+345) (testimony by victim that, during a robbery, a robber stated that defendant, one of the other robbers, would hurt him if he did not turn over money was not hearsay).
