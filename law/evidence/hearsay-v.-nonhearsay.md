{% hint style="info" %}
#### Five people decide to rob a bank, one goes in with a note that says, “Your money or your life.”

That statement is admissible against all of the robbers
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### One robber goes home and tells his wife “We robbed a bank today.”

This is not admissible because, although it was made by a coconspirator, it was not during or in furtherance of the robbery
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the conspiracy or participation under (E).&#x20;
