The defendants point out that Dominguez, as a customs officer, had to own a gunWe do not see how one could say the evidence is irrelevant.the fact that Dominguez owned a gun makes his guilt somewhat more probable than if he did not own a gunThe defendants point out that the chain of inferences is far weaker than if the government had introduced the gun itself into evidence, for then experts could have tested it to see if it matched the bullet that killed Mitri.Thus, the weaker evidence may have been all that the government had availableNo one claimed that this particular piece of evidence proved guilt. It was merely one piece of evidence among many. . . .A brick is not a wallUnder our system, molded by the tradition of jury trial and predominantly oral proof, a party offers his evidence not en masse, but item by item.

rationale for the law's general prohibition on introducing character evidenceextraordinary risk criminal defendants run when they choose to make character an issueThe inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.But this line of inquiry firmly denied to the State is opened to the defendant because character is relevant in resolving probabilities of guilt.He may introduce affirmative testimony that the general estimate of his character is so favorable that the jury may infer that he would not be likely to commit the offense charged.The witness is, however, allowed to summarize what he has heard in the community, although much of it may have been said by persons less qualified to judge than himself.The witness may not testify about defendant's specific acts or courses of conduct or his possession of a particular disposition or of benign mental and moral traits; nor can he testify that his own acquaintance, observation, and knowledge of defendant leads to his own independent opinion that defendant possesses a good general or specific character, inconsistent with commission of acts charged.as to the shadow his daily life has cast in his neighborhoodpresumably honest because disinterested, and safer to be trusted because prone to suspecIt sums up a multitude of trivial detailsthe delicate and responsible task of compacting reputation hearsay into the "brief phrase of a verdict" is one of the few instances in which conclusions are accepted from a witness on a subject in which he is not an expert.The price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him.it is not the man that he is, but the name that he has which is put in issue

### [Schafer v. Time, Inc.](https://chartacourse.com/c/oliver-evidence/schafer-v-time-inc-)

In an action for defamation or libel, however, the issue of the plaintiff's reputation and character scarcely can be avoided because the plaintiff typically seeks to recover compensation for damage to his or her reputation.Time's article, therefore, erroneously identified Schafer, then working in his family's janitorial business in Austell, Georgia, both as a traitor to the United States government and a player in the bombing of Pan Am 103.Schafer . . . argues that the district court committed reversible error by permitting Time's counsel to question Schafer regarding a number of "specific acts of misconduct" during cross-examinationthe district court ruled that Time would be permitted to question Schafer about a felony conviction, a possible violation of his subsequent parole, convictions for driving under the influence, an arrest for writing a bad check, failure to file tax returns, failure to pay alimony and child support, and evidence concerning Schafer's efforts to change his name and social security numberOnly in cases in which a person's character is "an essential element of a charge, claim or defense," however, may a party offer evidence of specific instances of conduct. See Fed. R.Evid. 405(b).Character evidence does not constitute an "essential element" of a claim or charge unless it alters the rights and liabilities of the parties under the substantive law\[1] the chastity of a victim under a statute specifying her chastity as an element of the crime of seduction\[2] the competency of the driver in an action for negligently entrusting a motor vehicle to an incompetent driver.two examples in which character evidence constitutes such an essential element:a charge of defamation or libel commonly makes damage to the victim's reputation or character an essential element of the case.Georgia law confirmsTime's questions fell within the scope of Federal Rules of Evidence 405(a) and 608(b).We cannot say that the district court's decisions on these matters rose to the level of an abuse of discretion, nor can we say that Schafer suffered a "substantial prejudicial effect."

### [Commonwealth v. Adjutant](https://chartacourse.com/c/oliver-evidence/commonwealth-v-adjutant)

trial judges have the discretion to admit in evidence specific incidents of violence that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated\[1] Indeed, such evidence may be the jury's only means of assessing the likelihood of the defendant's account of the incident in a homicide case.During the trial, Adjutant's counsel sought to cross-examine Whiting's neighbors about his previous violent behavior and reputation for violence.barred testimony about Whiting's behavior while intoxicated, ruling that Whiting's violent past or reputation for violence was only relevant if Adjutant had been aware of them at the time of the stabbing.evidence of three violent acts committed by Whiting while he was intoxicated and within three months of his death was presented to the court.Whiting, while on cocaine, allegedly chased after his neighbor "like a raging bull" when confronted about vandalizing the common yard.threatened two neighbors with a butcher knife.threw boiling water on a friend with whom he was arguingIn almost every American jurisdiction, evidence of a victim's violent character may be admitted to support an accused's claim of self-defense under two distinct theories.First, it may be admitted to prove that at the time of the assault the defendant was reasonably apprehensive for his safety, and used a degree of force that was reasonable in light of the victim's violent tendencies.Second, it may be admitted as tending to prove that the victim and not the defendant was likely to have been the "first aggressor," where there is a dispute as to who initiated the attack.Under the first theory, the evidence is not admitted for the purpose of showing that the victim acted in conformance with his character for violenceunder the second theory, it is.Massachusetts has long followed the evidentiary rule that permits the introduction of evidence of the victim's violent character, if known to the defendant, as it bears on the defendant's state of mind and the reasonableness of his actions in claiming to have acted in self-defense.Under Rules 404 and 405 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, all Federal courts now permit the introduction of evidence of the victim's violent character to support a defendant's self-defense claim that the victim was the first aggressor.As one moves from the specific to the general in this fashion, the pungency and persuasiveness of the evidence declineswhere the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute and the victim has a history of violence, we hold that the trial judge has the discretion to admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant's claim of self-defense.

### [United States v. Beechum](https://chartacourse.com/c/oliver-evidence/united-states-v-beechum)

To establish that Beechum intentionally and unlawfully possessed the silver dollar, the Government introduced into evidence two Sears, Roebuck & Co. credit cards found in Beechum's wallet when he was arrested.The Government also introduced evidence indicating that the cards had been mailed some ten months prior to Beechum's arrest to two different addresses on routes he had serviced.The only contested issue concerning the silver dollar was whether Beechum intended to turn it in, as he claimed, or to keep it for himself.The obvious question is why would Beechum give up the silver dollar if he kept the credit cards.Without an issue other than mere character to which the extrinsic offenses are relevant, the probative value of those offenses is deemed insufficient in all cases to outweigh the inherent prejudice.First, it must be determined that the extrinsic offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant's character.Second, the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of rule 403.two-step test

### [Burchett v. Commonwealth](https://chartacourse.com/c/oliver-evidence/burchett-v-commonwealth)

Trooper Whitlock found an unopened, one-half gallon bottle of vodka in Appellant's vehicle.Appellant told the emergency room nurse that he drinks "anywhere from one-half to three-fourths of a gallon a day of vodka" and that he smokes marijuana daily, "one joint in the morning and one at night."A lab test of Appellant's blood later confirmed that Appellant drank no alcohol before the collision.A drug screen of Appellant's urine sample revealed the presence of three substances: benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium), opiates (e.g., Tylenol 3), and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (marijuana). courts have correctly been "reluctant to admit evidence that a person is a \`habitual drunk' or has a habit of reckless driving \[or smoking a joint every morning] \[because] such evidence may be more prejudicial than probative with respect to the issues in the case." Of course one of the most compelling reasons to exclude habit evidence is presented by the facts of this case.Appellant stated that, in addition to smoking marijuana daily, it was his normal routine to drink one-half to three-quarters of a gallon of vodka daily. If habit evidence were admissible, Appellant's drinking practice would have been admissible as substantive evidence that Appellant had likely been drinking on the day of the collision. That evidence would undoubtedly weigh heavily on the minds of the jurors. But that evidence would have been utterly false.Unfortunately for Appellant, his blood sample could not be tested and the drug test results could not corroborate his testimony that he did not smoke marijuana that morning, so evidence of his daily smoking was admitted.dangerous non sequitur that the habit evidence rule encouragesthe evidence of Appellant's marijuana use should have been excluded.Character and habit are close akin. Character is a generalized description of one's disposition, or of one's disposition in respect to a general trait, such as honesty, temperance, or peacefulness. "Habit," in modern usage, both lay and psychological, is more specific. It describes one's regular response to a repeated specific situation.The elements of a habit are generally said to be (1) regularity, (2) specificity, and (3) an involuntary or semiautomatic response.Thus, in United States Football League v. National Football League, 842 F.2d 1335 (2d Cir.1988), evidence that the National Football League disregarded antitrust advice three or four times over a twenty-year period was insufficient to prove a pattern of behavior amounting to habitevidence that the plaintiff regularly drank a six-pack of beer four nights a week was held to be sufficient evidence of habitual conduct to be probative of his intoxication on the occasion of his injury. in Keltner v. Ford Motor Co., 748 F.2d 1265 (8th Cir.1984)Except for Kentucky, Massachusetts is the only jurisdiction that purports to preclude evidence of habit to prove conforming conduct.whether Appellant smoked marijuana on the morning of the collision would not have been relevant to prove that he drove past the stop sign and into the intersection at Bloyds Crossing without slackening his speed. However, it was relevant to prove the element of a criminal mens rea of wantonness or recklessness, i.e., to prove why he ran the stop sign and drove into the intersection without slackening his speed.His admitted habit of smoking two marijuana cigarettes every day, one in the morning and another at night, was highly probative of that theory.instances of past conduct ("every morning") were "numerous enough to base an inference of systematic conduct."

Thus, the latter argument was that there existed strong policy reasons for ruling that such utterances were hearsay.The proponents of the will offered to introduce into evidence letters to the testator from certain absent individuals on various business and social matters. The purpose of the offer was to show that the writers of the letters believed the testator was able to make intelligent decisions concerning such matters, and thus was competent.proof of a particular fact which is not of itself a matter in issue, but which is relevant only as implying a statement or opinion of a third person on the matter in issue, is inadmissible in all cases where such a statement or opinion not on oath would be of itself inadmissible; and, therefore, in this case the letters which are offered only to prove the competence of the testator, that is the truth of the implied statements therein contained, were properly rejected, as the mere statement or opinion of the writer would certainly have been inadmissible."The drafters of the Federal Rules agreed with the criticisms of the common law rule that implied assertions should be treated as hearsay and expressly abolished it.unlessan "assertion" concerning the matter sought to be proved and that no nonverbal conduct should be considered as hearsay, unless it was intended to be an "assertion" concerning said matter. The relevant provisions are:"Subdivision (a)(2) of Rule 801 removes implied assertions from the definition of statement and consequently from the operation of the hearsay rule."utterances of the betters telephoning in their bets were nonassertive verbal conduct, offered as relevant for an implied assertion to be inferred from them, namely that bets could be placed at the premises being telephoned.implied assertion, the proffered evidence is expressly excluded from the operation of the hearsay rule by Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the objection thereto must be overruled.unknown callers stated directions for the placing of bets on various sporting events.

Penny was still bleeding from a fresh cut that she presumably incurred during the startling event of being drugged and going through a window.

Ross.the Detroit Recorder's Court ruled the evidence admissiblethe prosecutor argued that the purported will was admissible under MRE 803(15) as an exception to the hearsay rule. Defendant argued that MRE 803(15) was inapplicable because disposition of property was not at issue and because the writing was not a valid holographic will as it was not dated or signed.At issue is a less than 2 1/4-page handwritten statement on 8 1/2 X 11 inch paper, allegedly prepared by defendant's wife, Jearleane Burton.a two-page narrative explaining that Burton was in fear for her life and detailing the events surrounding the killing and mutilation of the victim by defendant. The writing concludes, "Anything I own that would \[sic] please go to my mother and family."Mrs. Burton's statement must be sufficiently related to a disposition of property to guarantee its trustworthiness under the exception. In this case, we find it is not.whether or not the writing purports to establish or affect an interest in property, the lengthy description of the crime is not a matter germane to the purpose of the document.First, the only elements of the writing that are testamentary in nature are the first and last sentences of the 2 1/4-page documennot testamentary but more akin to a journal entry or confessionno specific disposition of property is mentionedAdditionally, the manner of execution of the writing detracts from its trustworthiness. The "purported" will is not dated, signed or witnessed.We therefore find the writing to be an unreliable, untested out-of-court assertion. As such, its introduction into defendant's criminal proceeding to establish the truth of the matters asserted is directly offensive to the hearsay rule.prosecutor seeks to introduce the statement of Jearleane BurtonAt issue is a less than 2 1/4-page handwritten statement on 8 1/2 X 11 inch paper, allegedly prepared by defendant's wife, Jearleane Burton.two-page narrative explaining that Burton was in fear for her life and detailing the events surrounding the killing and mutilation of the victim by defendant.

IndianaAmy alone on the front porch, appearing "\`somewhat frightened\`nothing was the matterHersheltold the police "that he and his wife had \`been in an argument'\`never became physical.'fill out and sign a battery affidavit."Broke our Furnace & shoved me down on the floor into the broken glass.

Attacked my daughter."State called the officer who had questioned Amytrial court admitted the affidavit as a "present sense impression,"Amy's statements as "excited utterances"whether, objectively considered, the interrogation that took place in the course of the 911 call produced testimonial statements.interrogations solely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator.reduced to a writing signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is testimonial."\`\[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.'A 911 call, on the other hand, and at least the initial interrogation conducted in connection with a 911 call, is ordinarily not designed primarily to "establis\[h] or prov\[e]" some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.Davis, McCottry was speaking about events as they were actually happening, rather than "describ\[ing] past events,"Sylvia Crawford's interrogation, on the other hand, took place hours after the events she described had occurred. Moreover, any reasonable listener would recognize that McCottry (unlike Sylvia Crawford) was facing an ongoing emergency.McCottry's call was plainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat.nature of what was asked and answered in Davis, again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve the present emergency,rather than simply to learn (as in Crawford) what had happened in the past.difference in the level of formality between the two interviews is striking. Crawford was responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questionsMcCottry's frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.When the officers first arrived, Amy told them that things were fine, id., at 14, and there was no immediate threat to her person.It is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct—as, indeed, the testifying officer expressly acknowledgednot seeking to determine (as in Davis) "what is happening," but rather "what happened." Objectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime—which is, of course, precisely what the officer should have done.The Court therefore found the statements in Davis not to offend the Sixth Amendment as they were not testimonial

When Mills denied knowledge of such an organization the prosecutor recalled Ehle.Mills, called by respondent, testified that Ehle told him in prison that Ehle planned to implicate respondent falsely.Ehle testifiedindeed members of a secret prison organization"lie, cheat, steal \[and] kill" to protect each other.Ehle then further described the organization and testified that "in view of the fact of how close Abel and Mills were" it would have been "suicide" for Ehle to have told Mills what Mills attributed to him.since respondent did not take the stand, the testimony could not have been offered to impeach him and it prejudiced him "by mere association."evidence showing Mills' and respondent's membership in the prison gang was sufficiently probative of Mills' possible bias towards respondent to warrant its admission into evidencetrial court must allow some cross-examination of a witness to show bias.Ehle's testimony about the prison gang certainly made the existence of Mills' bias towards respondent more probable.Biasrelationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a partyProof of bias is almost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher of credibility, has historically been entitled to assess all evidence which might bear on the accuracy and truth of a witness' testimony.the body of common law knowledge continues to exist, though in the somewhat altered form of a source of guidance in the exercise of delegated powers.""common law of evidence" allowed the showing of bias by extrinsic evidence, while requiring the cross-examiner to "take the answer of the witness" with respect to less favored forms of impeachment.Respondent claims that the prosecutor cross-examined Mills about the gang not to show bias but to offer Mills' membership in the gang as past conduct bearing on his veracity. This was error under Rule 608(b), respondent contends, because the mere fact of Mills' membership, without more, was not sufficiently probative of Mills' character for truthfulnessno rule of evidence which provides that testimony admissible for one purpose and inadmissible for another purpose is thereby rendered inadmissible; quite the contrary is the case.It was enough that such evidence could properly be found admissible to show bias.

She was erroneously and prejudicially denied that opportunitythere is a beguiling temptation to overanalogize Present Recollection Revived and Past Recollection Recorded.erroneously measured the legitimacy of the effort to revive present recollection against the more rigorous standards for the admissibility of a recordation of past memory.Had the appellant herein sought to offer the police report as a record of past recollection on the part of Officer Bolton, it is elementary that she would have had to show, inter alia, that the report had either been prepared by Officer Bolton himself or had been read by him and that he can now say that at that time he knew it was correct.It is the difference between evidence and non-evidence.present recollection revivedrecall, which is the reproduction of what has been learned, and recognition, which is recall with a time-factor added, or an awareness that the recall relates to past experience."But the witness must swear that he is genuinely refreshed.... And he cannot be allowed to read the writing in the guise of refreshment, as a cloak for getting in evidence an inadmissible document."under oath and subject to cross-examination asserts that it is true; his capacities for memory and perception may be attacked and tested; his determination to tell the truth investigated and revealed; protestations of lack of memory, which escape criticism and indeed constitute a refuge in the situation of past recollection recorded, merely undermine the probative worth of his testimony.Maryland has long established it that even when a writing of some sort is the implement used to stir the embers of cooling memory, the writing need not be that of the forgetful witness himself, need not have been adopted by him, need not have been made contemporaneously with or shortly after the incident in question, and need not even be necessarily accurate. The competence of the writing is not in issue for the writing is not offered as evidence but is only used as a memory aid.writing in question is to be utilized simply "to awaken a slumbering recollection of an event"\[8] in the mind of the witness, the writing may be a memorandum made by the witness himself, 1) even if it was not made immediately after the event, 2) even if it was not made of firsthand 602\*602 knowledge and 3) even if the witness cannot now vouch for the fact that it was accurate when made.writing in question is to be utilized simply "to awaken a slumbering recollection of an event"\[8] in the mind of the witness, the writing may be a memorandum made by the witness himself, 1) even if it was not made immediately after the event, 2) even if it was not made of firsthand 602\*602 knowledge and 3) even if the witness cannot now vouch for the fact that it was accurate when made.made by one other than the witness, even if never before read by the witness or vouched for by him.All that is required is that it ignite the flash of accurate recallthat it accomplish the revival which is sought.If upon looking at any document he can so far refresh his memory as to recollect a circumstance, it is sufficient; and it makes no difference that the memorandum is not written by himself, for it is not the memorandum that is the evidence but the recollection of the witness.""It may be anything.It may be anything which produces the desired testimonial prelude, "It all comes back to me now."a song, a scent, a photograph, an allusion, even a past statement known to be false.quite immaterial by what means the memory is quickenedthe appropriate effort of the appellant to jog the arguably dormant memory of the key police witness on a vital issue was unduly and prejudicially restricted.

Virginia and Glen Whidby brought this wrongful death action on behalf of their daughter, Janet Whidby, against Marion A. Williams, the driver of a tractor trailer truck, the owner of the truck, Columbine Carrier, Inc., and its insurer The Insurance Companywhen he struck Janet Whidby's vehicle at the intersection of Highway 96 and Moody Road.plaintiffs contended and sought to prove defendant Williams was speeding and driving too fast for conditionsraininginvestigated 12 or 15 wrecks involving a tractor trailer and a car.\[A]ppellants contend it was error to exclude the investigating officer's opinion concerning Williams' speed at the time of the collisionofficer would have testified that in his opinion, Williams' truck was traveling 75-80 mph.Officer Pagura testifiedarrived at the scene at 11:17 p. m., shortly after the collision occurredattended an advanced course in accident investigation at the Georgia Police Academyofficer testified he measured the distance between the Fiat's point of rest and the tire rim gouge marks at point of impact; this was 147 feet, 3 inches.amount of destruction depicted in photographs in evidence, it "literally would appear the \[Fiat] explodedPagura, testified he had investigated probably several hundred accidentstestified that speed of the vehicles can be estimated and "\[backed] up 100% if there are skidmarks," but if there are no skidmarks, speed can be estimated from the damage done to the vehicles and the distance they travel after impactWhen he attempted to give his opinion as to the speed of the truck, objection was made and the trial court held the officer had laid no proper foundation for an opinion because he could not relate speed to distance from impactofficer stated he based his opinion upon the defendant's statement to him that he was in a hurry to get home, and upon the degree of damage done and distance from point of impact to point of rest.Again the court refused an opinion because the officer had "still not made that causal link that we're looking for as far as him being qualified as an expert... he had yet to show how \[what he found at the scene] related to the particular miles per hour... which I think is required of an expert...."trial court ruled that he could not even give his opinion as a layman because "he did not see the accident ... he has not given any testimony of how what he found related to speed."outside the jury's presence, the witness was allowed to proffer his opinion that the truck was going 75-80 mph, that in his opinion the truck driver "was coming on around the bend ... at a high rate of speedThe court ruled he was not qualified as an expert or a layman to give an opinion. Ultimately the court stated: "Based on what I've heard the \[expert] say ... he could not calculate the speed and based on that from what I gather it would simply be a guess as to what speed, any speed he would give in his testimony and that's the reason I'm not allowing him to testify because ... it's just simply a guess and that's not an opinion the way I see it."The court ruled he was not qualified as an expert or a layman to give an opinion. Ultimately the court stated: "Based on what I've heard the \[expert] say ... he could not calculate the speed and based on that from what I gather it would simply be a guess as to what speed, any speed he would give in his testimony and that's the reason I'm not allowing him to testify because ... it's just simply a guess and that's not an opinion the way I see it."trial court erred in excluding the officer's opinion as to speed of the truck.well established that whether a witness has such learning and experience in a particular art, science, or profession as to entitle him to be designated as an expert, or to be deemed prima facie an expert, is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and such discretion will not be disturbed unless it is manifestly abused.no doubt a police officer with investigative experience on automobile collisions is an expert.rial court ruled was that the opinion was "simply a guess" and therefore was not competent to prove speed, but this goes to the 645\*645 worthiness or credibility of the evidence, which is the entire jury question.Police officers who are experienced in investigating collisions may give an opinion as to speed based on physical evidence as to how far the vehicles traveled after impact and the damage incurred after impact, even though the officers did not see the collision, may not have shown that they had learning and experience to qualify themselves as experts, and even where one stated he did not consider himself an expertA qualified witness may give opinion evidence as to speed based on data observed immediately after a collision, such as skid marks, distances, and the positions of and damage to the vehiclesThis officer's opinion as to speed was admissible whether he be considered a lay person or an expert.Plaintiff's attorney interjected that the witness testified he "learned how to estimate speed on physical damage to the vehicles and how far they traveled after," but the court said "he has not told us how he could do it."I've never seen a wreck like that at 55 miles per hour whether it be an 18 wheeler or a small sports car.The officer's opinion, based on training and experience in judging the degree of damage done to the vehicles and the distance they traveled after impact, was not a "mathematical calculation," but the law of evidence does not require an opinion as to speed to be a mathematical calculation to be admissible.tThe officer was asked to state how he applied his formulae learned in training;

Scales, 594 F.2d 558, 562 (6th Cir.1979).Third, and relatedly, "\`\[c]ommentators and other courts have agreed that Rule 1006 requires that the proponent of the summary establish that the underlying documents are admissible in evidence.'"if the underlying documents are hearsay and not admissible under any exception, a chart or other summary based on those documents is likewise inadmissibleRule 1006's provision that the underlying documents need not themselves be in evidenceFourth, reasonably enough, a summary document "must be accurate and non-prejudicial."provide the opposing party who desires to attack the authenticity or accuracy of a chart, summary, or calculation, with an opportunity to prepare for cross-examination, or to offer exhibits of its own as rebuttal evidence, which would serve to counteract the impression made on the jury by the proponent's witnessNothing should be lost in the translation.not embellished by or annotated with the conclusions of or inferences drawn by the proponentlabels, captions, highlighting techniques, or otherwiseFifth and finallyy, a summary document must be "\`properly introduced before it may be admitted into evidence.'"the proponent should present the testimony of the witness who supervised its preparationThe problem hinges on the distinction between Rule 1006 summaries and summaries used as "pedagogical devices," which are more properly considered under Rule 611(a). The distinction was clearly explained in Gomez:pedagogical devices "are more akin to argument than evidenceQuite often they are used on summation.the term "pedagogical device" to mean an illustrative aid such as information presented on a chalkboard, flip chart, or drawing, and the like, that (1) is used to summarize or illustrate evidence, such as documents, recordings, or trial testimony, that has been admitted in evidence; (2) is itself not admitted into evidence; and (3) may reflect to some extent, through captions or other organizational devices or descriptions, the inferences and conclusions drawn from the underlying evidence by the summary's proponent. This type of exhibit is "\`more akin to argument than evidence' since \[it] organize\[s] the jury's examination of testimony and documents already admitted in evidence."there are three kinds of summaries: (1) Primary-evidence summaries, such as those at issue here, which summarize "voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs" that, because they are so voluminous, "cannot conveniently be examined in court." Fed.R.Evid. 1006. In this instance, the summary, and not the underlying documents, is the evidence to be considered by the factfinder. See 1 EDWARD J. DEVITT ET AL., FEDERAL JURY PRACTICE AND INSTRUCTIONS § 14.02 (4th ed.1992); 1 LEONARD B. SAND ET AL., MODERN FEDERAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS (Criminal) ¶ 5.05, p. 5-34 (1997). (2) Pedagogical-device summaries or illustrations, such as chalkboard drawings, graphs, calculations, or listings of data taken from the testimony of witnesses or documents in evidence, which are intended to summarize, clarify, or simplify testimonial or other evidence that has been admitted in the case, but which are not themselves admitted, instead being used only as an aid to the presentation and understanding of the evidence. For these the jury should be instructed that the summaries are not evidence and were used only as an illustrative aid. See 1 DEVITT, supra, § 14.02; 1 SAND, supra, ¶ 5.05, p. 5-35. (3) Secondary-evidence summaries that are a combination of (1) and (2), in that they are not prepared entirely in compliance with Rule 1006 and yet are more than mere pedagogical devices designed to simplify and clarify other evidence in the case. These secondary-evidence summaries are admitted in evidence not in lieu of the evidence they summarize but in addition thereto, because in the judgment of the trial court such summaries so accurately and reliably summarize complex or difficult evidence that is received in the case as to materially assist the jurors in better understanding the evidence. In the unusual instance in which this third form of secondary evidence summary is admitted, the jury should be instructed that the summary is not independent evidence of its subject matter, and is only as valid and reliable as the underlying evidence it summarizes. See United States v. Citron, 783 F.2d 307, 317 n. 10 (2d Cir.1986). Since, in this case, it is clear that the summaries at issue are within the first of the three categories we have described, and were admitted under Rule 1006, the district court's refusal to give a limiting instruction in its final instructions to the jury was proper. There was no error, let alone reversible error. To be sure, the district court mistakenly gave a limiting instruction sua sponte when it admitted the government's summaries, but this error was one that favored Bray. Obviously, it provides no basis for overturning his convictions.

### [Hendrickson's Estate](https://chartacourse.com/c/oliver-evidence/hendricksons-estate)

dispute between a daughter of decedent and decedent's estate concerning the ownership of a diamond ring.urged that the court below erred in two respects: (1) in concluding that the unexplained possession by the decedent of the ring for 16 years following his wife's death was sufficient to infer ownership of the ring by decedent and his estate; and (2) in concluding that appellant's testimony was incompetent under the Act of 1887, supra.the court found that the unexplained possession of the ring for 16 years by the decedent was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of ownership which cast upon the appellant the burden of going forward with the evidence.court below held that her testimony was incompetent under the Act of 1887, supra, and the propriety of this ruling is now questioned. Appellant contends the testimony is competent because the decedent had no right to the ring which passed to his executor, a party of record.Under this exception three conditions must exist before any such witness is disqualified: (1) the deceased must have had an actual right or interest in the matter at issue, i.e. an interest in the immediate result of the suit; (2) the interest of the witness — not simply the testimony — must be adverse; (3) a right of the deceased must have passed to a party of record who represents the deceased's interest.Applying the test in Dillon's Estate, supra, if appellant's exception were sustained and her claim allowed, she would gain as the "direct legal operation and effect of the judgment" by receiving ownership and possession of the ring.Appellant's testimony was properly excluded and such exclusion related not only to testimony as to transactions between appellant and her deceased father, but also as to any matter occurring before her father's death which had any bearing on the ring transactioncorrectly and properly dismissed the claim of Blanche Reid.This fourth exception — so far as pertinent herein — disqualifies as a witness a "surviving" or "remaining" party or "other person" whose interest is adverse to one who is dead and proscribes any testimony by such party or person against the deceased as to matters which occurred before death if the deceased had any right in the subject matter which has passed to a party of record. This disqualification extends to two classes of witnesses (surviving parties to a transaction and any other person) whose interest is adverse to deceased:
