<p>Decision-makers rely on financial information that adheres to guidelines set forth by authoritative bodies so that analysis and comparison of company data are reasonable.</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the main generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) that have been developed by FASB, the AICPA, the SEC, and a number of other leading institutions?</li>
<li>Name the modifying constraints that are customary in practice when a deviation from the strict application of the generally accepted accounting principles is necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The concepts of generally accepted accounting principles and modifying constraints play an important role in the life of an accountant. Users of financial information rely on consistency and the application of both. Study the definitions in <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41249/mod_resource/content/4/AccountingPrinciples.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Major Principles</a>&nbsp;on pages 259-267 and <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41249/mod_resource/content/4/AccountingPrinciples.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modifying Conventions (or Constraints)</a>&nbsp;on pages 267-269.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1b. Apply the accounting equation to illustrate the impact of business transactions and to transform business transactions (data) into usable information</strong></h3>
<p>The accounting equation illustrates the relationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the accounting equation? How do business transactions affect the accounting equation? Given two of the three numbers, could you solve for the third?</li>
<li>In what order are the main four financial statements produced?</li>
<li>From a company's chart of accounts, what types of accounts are includes in the income statement and balance sheet? Name some examples of each type of account.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be very familiar with the accounting equation and the effects of accounting transactions on the equation. Be sure you are able to identify assets, liability, equity, revenue, and expense accounts as well as their locations in financial statements. More information can be found in <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41249/mod_resource/content/4/AccountingPrinciples.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Statements of Business Organizations</a>&nbsp;on pages 34-39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1c. Identify the foundational accounting concepts, assumptions, or principles through the analysis of specific business situations</h3>
<p>When an accountant decides not to pursue the correction of an accounting error because the time and money involved to fix the error are greater than the error itself, the accountant's decision is supported by one of the modifying constraints of accounting.</p>
<p>The overall mistake must not be considered a material amount if an accountant opts to leave the error in the records. Accounting principles may be ignored when the amount involved is small enough that readers of the financial statements would not be misled. Can you name the modifying constraint upon which the accountant is relying?</p>
<p>Detailed information about the accounting principles and modifying constraints can be found <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41249/mod_resource/content/4/AccountingPrinciples.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Objectives of Financial Reporting</a>&nbsp;on pages 270-276.</p>

<p>The first step in accounting for purchases of property, plant, and equipment is to debit the asset account for the purchase price. Next, allocate a portion of the purchase price to depreciation expense at the end of each accounting period during the asset's useful life. Additional capital expenditures related to the asset are also recorded during the asset's useful life. Finally, a journal entry is required when an asset is sold, retired, or scrapped.</p>
<p>Practice calculating depreciation expense for property, plant, or equipment and the related journal entry.</p>
<p>For help with recording depreciation expense, read <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41480/mod_resource/content/19/AccountingPrinciples2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depreciation of Plant Assets</a>&nbsp;on pages 77-89.</p>
<p>Due to the historical cost concept of accounting, assets are recorded at their purchase price and depreciated during their useful lives.</p>
<p>The book value of an asset is calculated as the purchase price minus accumulated depreciation. Accumulated depreciation represents all the depreciation that has been expensed to date. At the end of an asset's useful life, book value will equal its salvage value or zero.</p>
<p>What type of account is accumulated depreciation?</p>
<p>The accounting treatment of property, plant, and equipment is explained in detail in <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41480/mod_resource/content/19/AccountingPrinciples2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Recording of Plant Assets</a>&nbsp;on pages 71-76.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8b. Distinguish between tangible and intangible assets</h3>
<p>The accounting treatment for tangible assets is different than the accounting treatment for intangible assets. Tangible assets tend to be depreciated whereas intangible assets are either amortized or checked periodically for impairment.</p>
<p>What is the accounting treatment for leasehold improvements? Are they amortized, capitalized, or expensed?</p>

<h3>9b. Describe par value, discount, and premium as they relate to bonds</h3>
<p>Bonds often sell with accrued interest included in the purchase. The bond purchaser pays the accrued interest upfront with the expectation of being reimbursed with the receipt of the first bond interest payment.</p>
<p>What is the journal entry when a bond is issued with accrued interest? What is the journal entry when the first bond interest payment is paid?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9c. Explain how interest rates affect bond prices</h3>
<p>A bond is sold at face value, a discount, or a premium. The price at which a bond is sold depends on the market rate of interest and how it compares to the contract rate of interest.</p>
<p>How do you determine the price of a bond using present value calculations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9d. Account for bonds issued at par, a discount, or a premium</h3>
<p>The accounts "Discounts on bonds payable" and "Premium on bonds payable" require amortization.</p>

<h3>9e. Identify different types of capital stock and discuss differences between common stock and preferred stock</h3>
<p>Before attempting the final exam, make sure you are comfortable using the formula for calculating the book value per share of common stock outstanding, which divides total common stockholder equity by the total number of common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Corporations purchase their own stock for a variety of reasons. The purchased stock is called treasury stock and is considered issued but not counted as outstanding.</p>
<p>What are the reasons a corporation may choose to purchase treasury stock? How is treasury stock reported on the balance sheet?</p>

Information on treasury stock can be found on pages 248-253.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9f. Prepare a statement of shareholders' equity</h3>
<p>A statement of stockholders' equity is presented with the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. If a company has changes in their stock or paid-in capital, they show them in the columns of the statement of shareholder's equity. Each column reports changes to each of the accounts within the stockholders' equity section. It would be reasonable to expect columns for preferred stock, common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and treasury stock.</p>
<p>Each column reports a beginning balance and then reports transactions that affect the beginning balance. Finally, the ending balances are totaled to arrive at a total amount of stockholders' equity.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/pluginfile.php/41480/mod_resource/content/19/AccountingPrinciples2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement of Stockholders' Equity</a>&nbsp;on pages 247-248 for additional information about the statement of stockholders' equity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9g. Account for paid-in capital, cash dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and retained earnings appropriations</h3>
<p>Paid-in capital is simply the money contributed by stockholders and reported under the balance sheet's Stockholders' Equity section. It includes all classes of stock recorded at par value plus the amount received in excess of par.</p>
<p>Retained earnings are also listed under the Stockholders' Equity section of the balance sheet and represent all the earnings accumulated in the business to date. When retained earnings and cash are sufficient, and the retained earnings have not been appropriated (set aside) for another use, a corporation's board of directors may decide to share the retained earnings with shareholders in the form of a dividend payment.</p>
<p>A cash dividend is the most common form of dividend payment and is paid out of retained earnings, which decreases a corporation's cash. Rather than declare a cash dividend, a corporation may elect to declare a stock dividend which distributes additional shares of stock to common stockholders. A stock dividend also decreases retained earnings but does not decrease cash.</p>
<p>A corporation's board of directors may also vote to declare a stock split, which decreases the par value of stock and increases the number of common shares. A stock split will divide each share of stock into 2 or more shares. For instance, a 4:1 (4 for 1) stock split will turn one share of stock into four shares and simultaneously divide the par value by four. To further illustrate, one share of stock with a par value of $40 that is split 4:1 will now equal four shares of stock with a par value of $10 each.</p>
<p>A corporation's board of directors declares dividends after reviewing the retained earnings and cash of the corporation and a vote.</p>
<p>As practice, name the three significant dates associated with payment of dividends. Know the journal entries associated with each of the significant dates.</p>
